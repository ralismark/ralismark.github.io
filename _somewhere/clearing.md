You find yourself in a clearing, surrounded by trees.

A mossy carpet covers the ground while golden light stream down from somewhere above.
You hear the sounds of chirping birds and rustling leaves in the distance.

It's quite comforting.
You feel safe here.

There are a few of doors stood up around this clearing.
You feel like they change when you're not looking.

- [A silver door with a pushbar sitting in the corner, wearing a flickering green EXIT sign on top of itself](/)
- [An worn door that is falling apart](#museum)
- A tall wooden door, once majestic but now rather aged. Locked...
- A red door.
- A path leading into the trees. Seems like it leads nowhere right now...
- [Sit for a bit](#clearing:sit)
