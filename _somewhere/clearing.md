You find yourself in a clearing, surrounded by trees.

A mossy carpet covers the ground.
Golden light streams down from somewhere above.
Birds chirp in the distance.
You feel comfortable here.

There are a few of doors stood around this clearing.
You feel like they change when you're not looking.

- [A white door with a pushbar sitting in the corner, wearing a flickering green EXIT sign on top of itself](/)
- [An worn door that is falling apart](#museum)
- A tall wooden door, once majestic but now rather aged. Locked...
- A path leading into the trees. Seems like it leads nowhere right now...
- [Sit for a bit](#clearing:sit)
