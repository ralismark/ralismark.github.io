You are on a train platform.
The floor is nicely tiled, and the edge has a white trim and a band of blue tactile bumps.

On the walls are spaces for posters.
The current ones aren't notable though...

You're glad the lights illuminating the space aren't fluorescent lights.

There's a screen hanging from the ceiling, that would show upcoming train services.

It's currently empty though...
