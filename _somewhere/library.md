Seems like this used to be the gift shop.
There's isn't anything to buy though, since all the shelving and table space has been cleared to make space for books.

<details markdown=1><summary>"Why do I feel like shit: A personal diagnostic guide"</summary>
# 1. Identity

You're trans, so forcing yourself to not be a woman will hurt.
Unfortunately, ✨society✨ means that will happen a bunch.

This'll broadly feel like depersonalisation -- you'll feel like you're conceptually falling apart.

The solution is to simply actually be a woman for a bit.
The easiest way to achieve this is usually just clothes.
Go look pretty!

# 2. Sleep

You're really sensitive to the time you wake up, though duration still matters.
If you wake up late, you'll feel generally shit even if you slept enough.
Which mean that if it's like 3am, you've already fucked up since you'll either wake up late or not sleep enough.

Waking up late makes you feel dazed.
You won't be able to think well, you'll also have a bit of derealisation.

(TODO what does not sleeping enough feel like)

There's not really a solution other than to wait till night and try again.
**Do not, under any circumstances, drink coffee**.

# 3. Blood Sugar

You need a surprisingly high amount of energy per day.
The target is like 10'000 kJ, which is 2400 Cal.
So if you doing a lot of brain work, or don't have a regular meal schedule, you're gonna be at risk of hypoglycemia.

Hypoglycemia looks a lot like regular exhaustion and can happen pretty quickly, so eating a bit of carb is always something to try.
There are a few telltale signs for it though (from [Hypoglycemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia)):

- Easily getting overstimulated, such as by people talking (and wanting sensory deprivation)
- Anxiety, unusual behaviour, and confusion
- Blurred vision
- Trouble talking

# 4. Burnout

This is constant in your life at this point, so try your best.
Reduce workload if possible.

# Conclusion

I hope you remember this and look at it when you do feel shit!
