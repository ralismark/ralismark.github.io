This space is currently being used a storage area.
There's stacks of cardboard boxes, some labelled, some not.

One corner of the room is cleared out for some sort of shrine.
You don' really recognise it.

There's a notebook nearby.

<details markdown="1"><summary>On Patron Saints</summary>
I'm still workshopping this idea but I think it'd be cool to have some sort of patron saint thing.
Maybe it'll evolve into a much bigger thing?

(the rest is illegible)
