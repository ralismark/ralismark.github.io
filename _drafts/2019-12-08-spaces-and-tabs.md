title: Spaces v. Tabs
excerpt: My opinion on spaces vs tabs
reason: unprofessional

The "holy war" between using spaces and tabs has existed pretty much since code ever written, with all programmers having their own strong opinions on the matter - from the 8-wide tabs of linux to the 4 spaces of PIP8, there is no conclusive standard on what to use. Here, I'll provide my own perspective on this matter. Adding fuel to the fire? Maybe.

From occasionally witnessing this debate, there seems to be one main argument in support of spaces:

However, this argument mainly stems from the need to _align_, rather than _indent_. Indeed, if you're only using tabs to align (and maybe a few spaces for more precision), this is the case - viewing with a tab width different to the one used to write will mess up the alignment. And in most cases, it's necessary to use spaces to align:

```python
do_thing(arg1,
         arg2,
         arg3)
```

Projects rarely have tabs be 3 or 9 characters, meaning spaces must be used for either the entire indent, or to fill in the remaining space after using some tabs.

It's this lack of distinction between indenting and alignment which makes space indenting much more commonly used. However, by distinguishing between these two uses, we can freely exploit the main benefit of tabs, their user-configurable width. Hence the rule becomes **tabs to indent, spaces to align**, also known as Smart Tabs. Aligned code looks aligned for everyone, and people are free to use whatever tab size they want.

I'm not completely sure about how easily editors can be configured to support this. I pretty much only use [Neo]Vim, and this behaviour cannot be achieved with just in-built settings. Plugins exist to support this, [including my own][2], which I use daily.
