excerpt: Shorter and less-polished content in the future?
---

I've been reading a lot of blogs (and similar content) recently, many of which are part of [#100DaysToOffload]. And it's got me thinking about my own post style.

Most of the stuff on my blog is longer technical content. Excluding the interactive posts, which aren't really blog posts at all, most of my recent posts are about explaining computer science / competitive programming techniques, and all pretty long posts.

A lot of stuff I've seen on [#100DaysToOffload] is shorter, less polished content, which I might try to aim for now. And hopefully have some variety in what I cover. I've got a few more work-in-progress technical posts, but those are less focused on competitive programming specifically.

I've also been reading people's posts on <https://www.lesswrong.com/>. Some of the more well-known and longer posts by Eliezer are quite meandering, and many don't have a clear theme running throughout the article, or could be expressed in fewer words. I guess that's one downside of longer articles. The core ideas are good though, so I might make a post summarising them, if that hasn't been done yet.
