I might have a larger variety of content in the future.

<!--more-->

I haven't mentioned it here, but I'm actually interested in many things other than just programming. One such thing is worldbuilding and creative things, which I've been trying to do a bit of in my spare time. I might also include stories from real life (which I had originally).

I'll definitely still keep making programming posts, but if/when I decide to, I'll post non-programming stuff. Right now, this'll go along with the other posts in the [main list of posts](/), but there's a chance I'll make a separate tab for this.

Nothing is final yet, especially due to the lack of non-programming content.
