title: WebRTC Hell - First Steps
tags: web

Since its release in 2011 (!), WebRTC has changed quite a bit, though with iffy
browser support and some poor design decisions. However, it exists as the only
way (right now) to do peer-to-peer browser communication. And it's a pain to
understand if you only want bidirectional data transfer, since most
introductions focus on media transmission. Not this one though.

As I've explained, the only way right now to do direct peer-to-peer
communication is with WebRTC. Normally, WebRTC is used for AV communication,
such as video calls. But, you can do direct, raw data communication with Data
Channels. But before you can do that, you need to connect to each other.

Say you have 2 browser client, Alice and Bob. With WebRTC, one client needs to
connect to the other. Here, Alice will initiate the connection and Bob will
connect to Alice.

# The API

To start, both Alice and Bob need to create an RTCPeerConnection.

``` javascript
// in their corresponding browsers
let pc = new RTCPeerConnection(servers);
```

> [The argument `servers`][1] describes the ICE servers to use. There are
> plenty of articles on this elsewhere.

At this point, Bob waits for Alice to create a connection. Before doing so,
Alice needs to [create a data channel][2]. Not sure why this needs to be done
before actually connecting, but it is.

``` javascript
// Alice:
let dc = pc.createDataChannel('dc')
```
