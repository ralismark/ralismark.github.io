Last month, I competed at the International Olympiad of Informatics in Baku, Azerbaijan. This week, while fun, had several interesting incidents that happened. I'm making a collection here so I don't forget these, and I'll update these as I get time to write them.

# Banana strategy

During the actual competition, contestants are able to request snacks from the CMS clarification tab - chocolate, a cupcake (which wasn't really a cupcake, but different kind of chocolate snack), an apple, and a banana. During the practice session, our team discussed strategy for what snacks to request.

- Both the chocolate and cupcake were high GI, so not very good for the middle of a brain-intensive competition.
- Apples were somewhat sticky, which wasn't great for when you're typing a lot.

Bananas were determined to be the most optimal choice in providing sustained energy if we get hungry. Also, we could just throw the peel on the ground when we're done.

Following this plan, I requested a banana during contest day 2. I hadn't had bananas for over a year before this, and this sparked a newfound liking for bananas.

# Bathroom Request

During contest day 2, I requested to go to the bathroom. However, after a few minutes, it got marked as "Done" despite them not actually taking me. In response, I submitted another request, and a bit later I was escorted to the bathroom and back. However, a few minutes after that, another person came up to me and asked if I had to go to the bathroom, and wasn't too happy when I said I didn't. Though a few minutes later, another person approached me *again*.

Yep, 2 requests and 3 responses. What I think happened was that when my first one was marked as done, a person was sent to get me, but it took a bit of time for them to actually reach me. I'm not sure why there was a third response though.
