<h1>404</h1>

{: #message .text-centre style="font-style: italic" }
This website works without javascript!

{: .text-centre }
Looks like nothing's here... maybe it got moved?

<script>
(() => {

const messages = [
  "ala li lon lipu ni",
  "Segmentation Fault (core dumped)",
  "I'd put an interesting message here but I can't think of one",
];

const picked = messages[Math.floor(messages.length * Math.random())];
document.querySelector("#message").textContent = picked;

})();
</script>
