title: My 2024 April Fools

For April Fools this year, I decided to change my username, profile picture, and _first name_  on Discord, the social platform I use the most:

- My username my usual online name of ralismark to _lycheeleaves_
- Where I had my offline name of temmie (or variations), I changed it to _lesley_

Originally, this was just meant to be a joke to confuse people.
This wasn't the first time I've done this actually, and previously I've changed everything back within a day once I had had enough fun, but things turned out a bit differently this time:

- I'm likely switching from ralismark to **lycheeleaves** as my main online name.
- **Temmie** is still my primary first name, but feel free to also call me Lesley.

# Not Quite A Joke

As it turns out, I've actually been wanting to change my online name for a while.
`ralismark` is the name I've gone by everywhere online since at least 2017.
But ever since transitioning, it's felt more and more distant from who I am -- the letters and sounds that make it up feel more masculine to me, but a part of that is probably just me associating it with pre-trans times.

In the past few months I've been playing around with new usernames.
I originally had a few criteria:

1. It should not be used by anyone else as a personal identifier for anything online.
	This way, when it appears it's most likely actually me and not someone else who had happened to come up with the same name before me.

2. There should only be one pronunciation, and it should be pretty intuitive.

3. It should be intuitive how to spell the username from the pronunciation, though I was less strict about this requirement after finding name after name already being used by someone else.

3. It should not be too long.

From this, one of the usernames I came up with was _kwellig_, which I quite liked and started switching to in a few places.
Notably, I had also added to my Discord display name in preparation for a switch, so when April 1st rolled around, I had to come up with something else to make sure I wasn't immediately recognised.

And so, I scrambled back to the document I was using to workshop usernames, saw "also lychee-homophones" and "leslieves", shook them together and got "lycheeleaves" out[^two-words].

[^two-words]: Concatenating two words for my name might've been inspired by a friend who has done similar for many of his online names.

# Real Name Policy

The origin of those two notes, and hence the etymology of _lycheeleaves_, is actually pretty interesting.
"lychee" is actually a rough transliteration of a Chinese name I came up with back to English, and "leaves" both conveniently portmanteaus onto _lesley_, and indirectly because I wanted a `.garden` TLD.

So where did _lesley_ come from?
Honestly, it, and leslie (pronounced identically) are just names I think are kinda neat.

.. admonition:: aside

	(Insert "I just think they're neat" meme template)

	The actual story behind what made me think of it was me telling someone a guy's name was Wesley, them mishearing it as Leslie/Lesley, and countering with "but that's a girl's name?"
	Well, Leslie Lamport exists and is a pretty cool guy.

Either way, Lesley, the generally feminine variant of the name, has been living in my head for quite a while, and so it was the obvious choice as an decoy name for April Fools.

# Why I'm Writing This

The actual day of April Fools rolled around, and I had a bit of fun with it and even really confused a person -- sorry areeb!

.. admonition:: aside

	Personally, despite the custom for fooling to stop after noon, it's much more fun  (and accomodating for people with later sleep schedules) if pranks last the whole day!

While originally these changes weren't meant to stay, it turns out that April Fools is actually a pretty good excuse to trial-run names (of any kind) without any commitment!
After using them and seeing them for the day, they started to grow on me.
This was helped by the fact that I had put thought into making them, and they definitely felt like names that fit my vibe.
And so, as most April Fools events concluded, mine remained.

_lycheeleaves_ will likely remain an online name for me, and _Lesley_ will become an additional name for me.

Which means I now have 7 first names.

# How many names???

Yep, there are 7 different first names that I've gone by:

1. My Chinese name.
2. My Chinese nickname -- the reduplicated one parents call their children by.
3. Deadname.
4. Shortening of deadname that I went by for a year or so before I realised I was trans.
	I used it as my actual first name so it counts.
5. _Temmie_.
6. The new Chinese name I made last year that "lychee" is derived from.
7. And now, _Lesley_!

With this many I'm practically fey now :) -- time to start asking people "can I get your name and pronouns?"
