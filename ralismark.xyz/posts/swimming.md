After so many years of avoiding the water for Trans&trade; reasons, I finally got some swimwear and got in the water :)

1. I used to really not like going swimming (both sea and pools) because of how cold I'd get, even if it was sunny.
This turned out to be almost entirely because I used to be incredibly skinny -- I've gained around 20kgs in the intervening years, and didn't get cold at all while many other skinnier people did.
Yay for weight gain!

0. The first thing I noticed when getting in the water was _water pressure against your stomach_!
It makes breathing feel quite different, but I faded into the background after a bit.

0. Buoyancy!
Trying to dive to the bottom of the pool, I both didn't have the technique and was really struggling with buoyancy, which I kinda forgot was a thing.

0. I didn't realise you could open your eyes underwater!
I've just straight up never tried before.

0. Hair gets in my face so much that I straight up cannot see for a few seconds after surfacing.

0. Swimming is surprisingly exhausting.
But it was also really fun :)
