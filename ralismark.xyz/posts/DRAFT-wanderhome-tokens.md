[Wanderhome](https://possumcreekgames.com/pages/wanderhome) is this really cool and cozy role-playing game a friend introduced to me a while ago.
I'd describe it as basically the antithesis of D&D -- exploring characters' journey through the world (both physical and metaphorical), and no combat.
And it has approximately _1 (one)_ gameplay mechanic -- the token system -- and it's really simple: you (as a _player_, not as the character) gain one from certain things, and you can spend one for certain things.
So it's pretty interesting to have a look at what these things are, how they guide play, and what kinds of stories they encourages us to tell.

.. admonition:: me/say

	Despite Wanderhome taking up permanent residence in both my mind and my heart, I've not actually _played_ that much of it.
	Mostly just due to chance, scheduling, finding people, and other real-world enemies of TTRPG campaigns.
	Which I'm kinda sad about :(

A good reference point for looking at the mechanics of role-playing games this way is D&D.
Combat takes centre stage there.
It's the focus of most rules, abilities, monsters, items, and so on, with _everything else_ tacked on via broad skills, self-contained subsystems, or otherwise pure role-play.
By taking up such a large part of the system, you can really _feel_ how you're pushed towards combat -- towards solving problems by fighting, as a player, and creating narratives that conclude with fights, as a GM.
This makes sense given its roots in wargaming, which is meant to tell stories of _realistic_ combat and whatnot.

In Wanderhome, gaining and spending tokens are some of the only _mechanical_ things you do.
The ways you can gain or spend them come from a few places:

1. The basic ones that you can always do.
2. Additional ones from your character's playbook
3. From the Natures of the place.
4. From the Traits of an NPC -- specifically only magical and traumatised traits.

There's a couple of themes across these.

# Asserting your authority on the world

The primary underlying theme behind 

# The setting as a character

Absent a singular GM responsible for dictating the setting, the narrative voice of the _setting_ is left up to the players.
The token system encourages this collaborative worldbuilding, with the majority of the basic ways to gain tokens about describing the wonder of the world.
















# You Can Always...

In the main rules of Wanderhome, it lists out a bunch of ways that you can gain tokens.
The first two -- inconveniencing yourself to help someone, and giving up someone you hold dear -- are about personal sacrifice for others. Then some about self-care -- getting some rest, or speaking your true feelings about something, with the rest for describing the wonder of the world -- watching and describing a tiny moment of beauty, or basking in and describing the grandeur of the world.





In the Director's Commentary, Jay Dragon says about the token system

> these rules don't exist to bind and enforce play but rather provide a sense of percussion to play, taking what would otherwise be freeform play and giving it some gentle pacing.
