You'll never know when your systems just stop working.
This is why you have multiple backups of your systems.
Sometimes, more that you think.
This is about the extremely roundabout way I recovered some files from a system crash.

I'm at school, about to start working on a programming assignment.
So I turn on my laptop...and it doesn't turn on.
Maybe force restarting (holding the button) will fix it?
Nothing.

At this point, I'm getting slightly worried, since I'll probably have to send it to the service centre.
Fortunately, I've just started doing full weekly backups, and this occurred the day after the first one.
So, if it does need to be repaired, and the technicians decide to factory reset the device (for whatever reason), I'll have a decently up to date copy of my data.

However, It'll still be a while until I can do that, and I need something to do for an hour.
There's no way of getting my full backup right now, so I look to my other backups - OneDrive.
I keep most of my files in OneDrive, which is synced whenever anything changes.
Additionally, it's usually accessible online.
I would be able to get this, except for another problem - the school proxy.
For some reason, the school's proxy blocks Microsoft services (e.g.
OneDrive, Outlook, etc.), so I'll need a way around this.

Here, \$netsec enters.
He has 3G, which effectively bypasses the proxy block.
So, using that as a hotspot, I download the files for the project.
Fortunately, he also has a copy of vim, which I also copy.
I have my vimfiles on github (albeit quite dated), which I download.
With these I am able to continue working on the programming project even without my computer.

Even though it's not a great story, this is why you should have redundant systems.

\$netsec will likely come up again in future stories, since he is basically the most experienced programmer (excluding myself) that I know.
He is also quite knowledgeable at networking and network security, much more than I, which is why he's \$netsec.
