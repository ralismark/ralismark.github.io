For a while now I've been thinking of moving away from [fosstodon.org] to another instance.
When I joined towards the end of 2020 it was quite a cozy place, with lots of cool people posting interesting content about their day and what they were working on.
But now, in the aftermath of Twitter, the number of users has multiplied and it definitely has a different atmosphere now, with lots of project-specific accounts and brief toots that simply redirect to a post on a different website.

[fosstodon.org]: https://fosstodon.org

And so, I recently created an account over on another instance, and it's making me have a think about what I actually want from an instance.
I think there's only a small number of things which actually differentiate instants:

1. Instance-specific features, such as emojis, post length, and so on.
2. Moderation, and federation or lack thereof.
3. The local feed.

And to be honest, the only one here I actually care about is the local feed, whose value is two-fold:

1. An "organic" stream of content that has way more volume and diversity than your home feed.
2. A way to share your posts with many other people that you normally wouldn't interact with.

Both you can opt-out -- not looking at it, and by posting unlisted -- but in both cases the people there have all more or less explicitly chosen to be part of it.
I think in a cozy instance there's a good deal of both, and people are conscious about when they put something into this shared stream.
And while that definitely was the case back in 2020 and 2021 -- I distinctly remember the local timeline being a selling point of fosstodon -- I feel like that's not that common anymore.

There's also the factor of culture -- different instances will attract different people, who have different norms.

Now, what kind of content do I personally want my local instance to have?

More fun and interesting content.

I wanna hear about what people were up to today, what their latest project is and how they're going with it.
I want jokes and memes, and people asking each other for advice.

News and "politics" definitely have their place but they're quite draining to me.
I guess filters can help with this.

Maybe a bit less stream of consciousness, and a bit more thoughtful contributions.

... Or maybe I just need an algorithmic feed trained on my tastes.
