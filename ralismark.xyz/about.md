# whoami

- compsci student @ UNSW
- retired competitive programmer
- (previously) SWE @ algorithmic trading firm [Autumn Compass](https://autumncompass.com/)

I poke at a bunch of computing areas -- recently Nix, Rust, and contributing to Open Source.
I've also had experience with C++ & Go & bits of infra.

I also like making frontend things the old-school way with handwritten HTML/CSS and a touch of JavaScript.
This includes this website you're looking at, [some games] (try [this one]!), and [my personal wiki app].

[some games]: /webgames/
[this one]: /webgames/basalt-bashers/
[my personal wiki app]: /ibis-wiki/static/

Outside of tech, I play violin and am trying to memorise more Chinese, and I like learning about linguistics.

## fun facts

1. Prominent Rust blogger [Amos / fasterthanli.me](https://fasterthanli.me) gave me a shout out on [one of his posts](https://fasterthanli.me/series/making-our-own-executable-packer/part-12#:~:text=Thanks%20to%20ralismark)!
2. [My keyboard](posts/keyboard) is featured [in the Sydney Morning Herald](https://12ft.io/https://www.smh.com.au/technology/people-are-spending-7500-on-keyboards-maybe-you-should-too-20220524-p5ao6h.html#:~:text=Keyboards%20can%20cost%20hundreds%20or%20even%20thousands%20of%20dollars), with an incorrect caption!

# colophon

This website uses my own mess of a static site generator (previously Jekyll), which primarily uses [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) and [Mistune](https://mistune.lepture.com/).
The code for that, as well as all the pages, is [on github](https://github.com/ralismark/ralismark.github.io)!
