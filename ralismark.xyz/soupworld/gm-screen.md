There is one principle underlying all "supernatural" phenomena in the world:

		Belief is Power

	.. html:: center

		If you believe something to be true, the it nudges the world towards one where it is.

Some examples of this:

- Stories, legends, traditions, and culture manifest as physical phenomena -- art imitates life, life imitates art.

- Prophecies are self-reinforcing, as your belief in them directly helps them unfold.

- Wilderness areas away from civilisation and divergence from traditional practices are more "unpredictable", since there are less people's beliefs holding things down.

- Even at a personal level, how you perceive the world impacts how you influence the world.

There are no gods in this world.
It's much more interesting to look at the other consequences of this principle.
There's some limits to this though.

# Rule of Locality

**Influence is local**.

A person's thoughts only affects those they're interacting with.
The beliefs of a town only affects the area around it.

A neat consequence of this is it gives me permission to make different places _much_ more varied, even down to the laws of reality.
Basically, I can put whatever I want into the world and chalk it up to "local culture".

# Rule of Reversal

**Power is belief**.
Powerful things are those that influence your beliefs and feelings.

- A powerful beast may supernaturally make you doubt yourself.

- When you come across a powerful magic, you might immediately know what it can do, with no idea where you came to know that -- its innate power leaking into the beliefs of those nearby.

# The Stars

One final thing.

The stars are the embodiment of _me_, the author.
They're everywhere and they see everything :)

# What's Left?

There's a few things I haven't decided on yet:

- What are the Sun and Moon, what do they represent?

- What's the cosmology?
	What's the shape of the world, what is there if keep going up into the sky?

	To be honest, I want to tell stories that are less grounded in our physical understanding of the world.
	Rather, I want more fantastical vibes, more akin to folklore and myths and whatnot.

And other miscellaneous details:

- The geography and layout of the world is based on Canada, modulo creative liberties.
	Coming clean with this direct copying heh, but I think the country is cool, and I'm not bothered creating a whole world.

	Yes, there is Mount Celeste, and yes it operates like in hit video game Celeste.
