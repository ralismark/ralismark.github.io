You find yourself in a clearing, surrounded by trees.

A mossy carpet covers the ground while golden light stream down from somewhere above.
You hear the sounds of chirping birds and rustling leaves in the distance.

It's quite comforting -- you feel safe here, yet you can sense that this place was not designed for you.

There are a few of doors stood up around this clearing, you feel like they change when you're not looking.
