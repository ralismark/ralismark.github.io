You find yourself on an underground train platform.

The area is illuminated in warm light that is very familiar to you.
The floor is nicely tiled, with the platform edge cleanly bordered by white paint and tactile dots.

A screen hangs from the ceiling.
You'd expect it to show the next train services, but current it just shows that there's no services here today.
