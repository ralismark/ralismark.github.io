You reach the base of a mountain.
The path crawls and weaves its way between the trees and up the slopes, disappearing into fog and cloud.

An individual in purple robes greets you, introducing himself as Autumn.

Besides him stands a signpost.
It announces the path upwards as "(undecipherable), 1ly".

There's a small tree sapling a bit further up the path, decorated with ribbons and notes waving gently.

"Blessings left by those who embark on the climb", Autumn explains.

The decorations wave gently, as if saying farewell.

You read some of the messages:
