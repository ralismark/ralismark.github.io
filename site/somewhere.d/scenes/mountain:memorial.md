At a certain place further up the steps, the bushes on the side part away, revealing a trail leading away from the stairs.

This trail gives way to a clearing as the ground becomes stone.
At the centre is a circular arrangement of pebbles, gathered from up and down the mountain.
They are tinted in various shades of greys and pastels.

A number of flowers have sprouted up around the memorial.
Even through the wind and the cold, they still cling on and thrive.

In the middle, a candle burns.

A number of flowers are planted around the memorial.

<p style="text-align: right"><em>For all of us that might not have made it.</em></p>

Even through the wind and the cold, they still cling on and thrive.

<p style="text-align: right"><em>Because despite everything, we're still here.</em></p>
