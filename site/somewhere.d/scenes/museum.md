You stand in the main lobby of a small museum.

It appears the original owners abandoned it long ago, and someone else has come and repurposed the space to display their own things!

At the counter there's a couple copies of a pamphlet:

<details markdown="1"><summary>Notes on "Somewhere"</summary>
Hey, it's me, Temmie!

The idea of creating this came to me after watching [a video about myhouse.wad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wAo54DHDY0).
I kinda wanted to make a 3d space that you could look around and explore, and use that as a creative medium.
This is also kinda inspired by [The Beginner's Guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beginner's_Guide).

Problem is, I didn't have any relevant game dev or 3d modelling experience and I didn't really want to learn, so this idea was shelved for a bit until I stumbled across [lunabee's archivespace](https://lunabee.space/archive.html).
That gave me the idea to create like a point-and-click adventure website.
This solves the skill problem -- I'm very comfortable with making website things, and know enough relevant tech to add any quirky features I would want.

Now, what's the reason behind this whole space?
It's sort of meant as a memorial to who I am:

- as a creative outlet, via a medium I'm already somewhat comfortable with
- as more concrete artifact of who I am, because memories are fallible and identity is variable

I don't have any big plans yet for this world, so right now it'll just be a hodgepodge of whatever inspiration I get.

- The passageway behind the desk, which appears to be the main entrance.
It's fenced off, and a sign stands in front, bearing the message "~~Under Construction~~ Redecorating!"
