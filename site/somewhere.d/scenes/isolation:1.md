As you continue down the path, you start to realise that the trees around you are starting to thin out.
Patches of empty space began popping up around the trees, until it became the trees that were spread in the space.
Until it became a grassland.

Something about the air changes as well.
The smell of healthy plants is gradually replaced by the smell of charred plant matter.
Greens turn to browns and blacks.
And something else...

There's now only the occasional tree still lingering around.
