You come across a circular arrangement of rocks, gathered from the up and down the mountain.

<p style="text-align: right"><em>For everything we're going through.</em></p>

A number of flowers are planted around the memorial.

<p style="text-align: right"><em>For all of us that might not have made it.</em></p>

Even through the wind and the cold, they still cling on and thrive.

<p style="text-align: right"><em>Because despite everything, we're still here.</em></p>

<br>

<p style="text-align: center">There are days where the universe says no.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">But some days, we say no to the universe.</p>
