Seems like this used to be the gift shop.
There's isn't anything to buy though, since all the shelving and table space has been cleared to make space for books.

# 1. Identity

You're trans, so forcing yourself to not be a woman will hurt.
Unfortunately, ✨society✨ means that will happen a bunch.

This'll broadly feel like depersonalisation -- you'll feel like you're conceptually falling apart.

The solution is to simply actually be a woman for a bit.
The easiest way to achieve this is usually just clothes.
Go look pretty!

# 2. Sleep

You're really sensitive to the time you wake up, though duration still matters.
If you wake up late, you'll feel generally shit even if you slept enough.
Which mean that if it's like 3am, you've already fucked up since you'll either wake up late or not sleep enough.

Waking up late makes you feel dazed, and you won't be able to think well.

Sleep duration is also pretty important, but the sleepiness from not sleeping enough is mostly in the morning and is less noticeable throughout the day, especially if you're actually doing something.
There's not really a solution other than to wait till night and try again.
**Do not, under any circumstances, drink coffee**.

If you are waking up early (like 7am) for stuff, your sleep will likely get disrupted for a bit.
In this scenario, you're probably pretty tempted to take a nap, and that's totally fine.
One important thing to keep in mind is that afterwards, your anxiety will really peak towards midnight.
So good luck, and try not to stay up too long :)

# 3. Blood Sugar

You need a surprisingly high amount of energy per day.
The target is like 10'000 kJ, which is 2400 Cal.
So if you doing a lot of brain work, or don't have a regular meal schedule, you're gonna be at risk of hypoglycemia.

Hypoglycemia looks a lot like regular exhaustion and can happen pretty quickly, so eating a bit of carb is always something to try.
There are a few telltale signs for it though (from [Hypoglycemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia)):

- Easily getting overstimulated, such as by people talking (and wanting sensory deprivation)
- Anxiety, unusual behaviour, and confusion
- Blurred vision
- Trouble talking

# 4. Burnout

This is constant in your life at this point, so try your best.
Reduce workload if possible.

# Conclusion

I hope you remember this and look at it when you do feel shit!

<details markdown=1><summary>"My Model Of Mental Health"</summary>
After going through a bunch of mental health stuff, I've somewhat got a mental model of how my mental health works.
In summary, even though specific topics may trigger anxiety and may be the target of anxiety, these are purely downstream (i.e. a consequence of) other stressors, such as poor sleep and physical wellbeing.
**Notably, the subject of anxiety is often not actually a stressor!**

Based on this, I've come up with steps for responding to anxiety.
The thing to remember is "Do Not Engage".
Or, in the style of first aid mnemonics, the three D's:

1. **Disengage** from the thoughts. Don't try reason with them.
2. **Distract** yourself.
3. **Deal** with stressors.

Firstly, actually engaging with the thoughts and trying to convince yourself away from the concerns is often not that productive.
Anxiety is as much an emotional thing as it is a reasoning thing, and a lot of the time trying to fight it is like fighting an oil fire with water i.e. very bad.

Secondly, the purpose of distraction is to give your brain something else to focus on.
The most accessible one is often youtube videos (like cooking videos which are a really nice comfort thing).
Other short-term coping mechanisms can also fall under here.

Finally, my mental model is that mental health issues are purely _downstream_ of the stressors, and anxiety can only be dealt with by dealing with those stressors that are promoting anxiety.
For this, have a look at "Why do I feel like shit: A personal diagnostic guide"!

I feel like this model of mental health issues being downstream of unrelated stressors is more healthy, since you have more control over those, and you also aren't fighting the anxiety while trying to deal with it.

<details markdown=1><summary>"Not Names"</summary>
I'm not entirely sure why, but a lot of people mishear my name when I tell them it.
And it's not just basic mishearings like "tammy" or whatever, I've had:

- Emily
- Kevin
- Kelly

There's also a shelf describing itself as "loans from elsewhere".
