We are writing a compiler.
%
Nobody will buy or use your compilers.
%
Do whatever you linke, as long as the code generated is correct.
%
Not really. If you think about it, you'll understand why.
%
I don't even know what your problem is. We don't need to add
%
The answer is obvious:
%
As I didn't see your code, I won't have a clue. But the error message tells you clearly what the problem is.
%
Don't know what you meant.
%
No. What is the point of doing that?
%
This should be straightforward. The theory can be summarised in one line, which has been left for you to figure out.
%
It works for me:
%
Given
%
Didn't you see this slide before? What is the last instruction in this example?
%
Yes, that is your job.
%
Your understanding is wrong.
%
This was explained many times. Why do you want to compare codes?
%
You misunderstood what I said.
%
I believe I have mentioned the following about five times in different lectures:
%
if you read the lecture slides
%
This is really something you need to figure it out yourself.
%
You won't be confused if you read the spec of this assignment before you ask this question.
%
No. That is another reason why this course is supposed to help one read better
%
why not
%
I won't know exactly what your problem is.
%
it is trivial
%
You need to understand the difference
%
No.

We are building a compiler.
%
Please read the assignment spec:
%
What do you think?
%
That is why one is supposed to do.
%
If you spend a few minutes reading
%
Please read
%
not really relevant,
%
Read the lecture notes
%
Why will Assignment 5 be an extension of Assignment 4?
%
The answer is obviously yes:
%
I hope you have figured out how to do this by now?
%
I didn't see your code. I don't know where your bug is. You need to spend some effort fixing this bug yourself.
%
Why not?
%
You are obviously expected to implement
%
is a black art, not science.
%
it is clear to your now.
%
Again,
%
Yes, you can see
%
No. Have you watched the lecture
%
I believe this is made clear in the spec.
%
causing this confusion?
%
The spec explains clearly
%
The answer is no.
%
You obviously don't need to do anything
%
You certainly can if you think they are useful.
%
I don't understand your question.
%
What is different from that?
%
You should have noticed
%
Attrbute => attribute

:)
%
ssh is also too slow.
%
you know how to do it yourself
%
I have replied to this, explained this in today's lecture, and also sent a message to the entire class
%
Please just delete it.
%
Just delete it.
%
delete it?
%
Sorry. Delete
%
Good
%
No. Don't do that.
%
OK. There was some misunderstanding on your side then.
%
spec is correct
%
With a bit of Google Fu.
%
In reality: with *extreme* difficulty,
%
compiler cannot be bothered
%
yep
%
Where did you do this?
%
It must be your own problem.
%
It works for me
%
I have no idea what you did.
%
I cannot reproduce your problem.
%
I have never seen a similar question before.
%
Your question is very general.
%
I also discussed this
%
You will find the answer
%
I don't know what you meant. Why
%
nothing wrong here.
%
not relevant
%
That is a requirement. First, you build
%
Why?
Explained in the lecture this Monday.
%
I don't think I understand what your question is.
%
This is something you should be able to figure it out yourself.
%
We don't know what your issue.
%
You must have done something wrong.
%
The problem you encountered has nothing to do with COMP3131/9102.

In fact, I already explained to you earlier how to avoid this problem:
%
This is not an issue
%
Good question!

The answer is no.
%
> Could you please give a hint? Thanks.

It works for me:
%
the answer is obviously yes
%
It is never mentioned anywhere this is how you will download these test cases. Why cannot you just go to our course page and down it there with one ONE CLICK?
%
I thought I have replied to this question.
%
Personal taste.
%
You need to figure this out yourself.
%
We don't care
%
I couldn't quite understand your question.
%
The solutions provided for this assignment will never be relevant
%
If you have failed in some test cases, this is not the reason.
%
How could anyone tell you what the problem is if you don't explain what it is.
%
You can easily create this test case locally and test yourself to see what the problem is.
%
How could anyone tell you what the problem is if you don't explain what it is.
%
I have just had a look at the recording. There was nothing missed.
%
Don't know what your question is. The solution provided is correct.
%
of course, according to the spec.
%
That is obviously just the letter x.
%
I don't know why you want this. That is already the answer.
%
How to handle tabs is actually done by just ONE line of code.
%
I think I have answered a similar question several times. We don't really care
%
If you don't produce the same output, then your output is obviously correct, since the reference output is correct.
%
I don't think you have read the FAQs for this assignment:
%
Those examples have answered your question.
%
Take a look at the spec.
%
Did you watch the lecture recording for the first lecture or did you read its slides?
%
1. No

2. Due to the assumption made for (1), this cannot happen.
%
There is actually no need to do that.
%
My message above has some "errors" as I replied from my phone. But you get the message.
%
You can write one easily yourself.
%
The answer is obviously yes
%
Hopefully, you have had a good sleep. Yes, that is a string.
%
Why is it confusing, one is keyword and the other representing true or false.

There cannot be any other possibility. Where does the confusion come from?
%
Yes, of course.
%
The answer is no.
%
No, you shouldn't use these. The reason is simple.
%
Could you please read the FAQs? That already contains the answer.
%
The spec explains how to set up everything for VC. Everything that you need to do is explained in the spec. I your case, you haven't set up your CLASSPATH correctly. Just follow the instructions in the spec.
