This is the first post of the (hopefully long-lasting) blog.
I'll be writing about a significant range of topics, from very low-level (e.g. assembly) to more higher level topics (e.g. web development), and much in between.

I started this since I had quite a few tech stories, and I thought, why not put them on a blog?
And here's the first post.

Not much more to it at this point.

# 2 Hard Problems

As once was said, one of the 2 hardest problems in computer science was naming things, such as this blog.
I didn't (and probably don't) have a good name for this.
For historical reference, at this point, it is called "triple except", and was chosen arbitrarily.
This came from the x86 triple faults (faults == exceptions), which was an [arbitrary article][1] I found on Wikipedia.
