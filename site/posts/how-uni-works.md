There's a lot of things about university that you don't learn until you *actually* start.

# Courses

Each term, you pick a certain number of courses to do.
At UNSW, you usually do 3 courses a term -- but you can do more (known as overloading) or less[^1] -- and there are 3[^2] terms.
These courses are pretty independent (barring prerequisites & other requirements) and last a term.
Some courses only run in certain terms, so people usually plan their degrees to make sure this isn't a problem.

[^1]: Reasons for doing this can include:

	<ul> {# TODO I don't know why regular markdown lists don't work #}
		<li>working part-time or full-time</li>
		<li>doing courses which have high workload</li>
	</ul>

[^2]: Most unis have 2 terms (semesters).
	Have a look at the whole trimesters mess if you want.

You'll also see the term *Units of Credit* (UOC) floating around, usually just called *Units*.
These refer to how much workload a course is meant to be.
Almost all courses are 6 UoC.

# Degrees

Degrees are what you come to uni to get.
They lay out a list of requirements (but not restrictions!) on what courses you need to do in order to get this degree.
There are:

- Core courses.
	These are ones you must do to get the degree.
- Electives.
	You get to pick a couple courses from a large set.
- Free electives.
	You can do any course for this.
- General Education (or gen-eds).
	For this, you need to pick a course that's *unrelated* to your degree from a given set.

For example, doing the non-specialising major ([COMPA1]) for [Computer Science degree][cs-degree] has 11 core courses, 5 regular electives, 6 free electives, and 2 gen-eds.

[COMPA1]: https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/specialisations/2021/COMPA1
[cs-degree]: https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/programs/2021/3778

If you do enough of the right courses to meet all the requirements, you get the degree!

# A note on changing degree

At UNSW, you can change your degree (known as [Internal Program Transfer][ipt], or IPT) at particular times of the year, and the process isn't too difficult.
Additionally, if the courses you've already done can count towards your new degree, they'll carry over.
This means that switching to a similar degree -- such as from CompSci to CompEng or CompSci/Math (dual degree) -- won't waste any of your previous work!

For this reason, you don't need to worry about picking the exact right degree.
Plenty of people change degrees -- I'd estimate around *half* of the people I know, but this is probably higher than the actual rate.
