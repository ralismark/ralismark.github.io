It's been about two years since [the last /uses](uses-2021).
So here's an update of what I'm using as we enter into 2024!

# Hardware

- **Dell XPS 13 (9360)** from late 2016, with 8GB RAM and an Intel i7-7500U (2 physical cores, x2 hyperthreading).
	I still haven't had the need for a beefy computing box, mostly since I don't play video games.
- **[keeb.io Nyquist v2](https://keeb.io/collections/nyquist-keyboard-collection)**, with blank XDA caps and Kailh Pro Purple switches.
	More details (including photo) on [the keyboard post](keyboard).

# System

I run **[NixOS](https://nixos.org/)** as the operating system for my laptop.
My system configuration is in [ralismark/nixfiles](https://github.com/ralismark/nixfiles).
I also use **[home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager)** (config also in that repo) to manage my dotfiles.

My filesystem is **ZFS**.
In addition to its compression features, I also do two main things with it:

1. I [wipe most of my system each boot](https://grahamc.com/blog/erase-your-darlings), with the parts that aren't wiped managed with **[impermanence](https://github.com/nix-community/impermanence)**.
	NixOS happily builds up the root directory from nothing each time I boot.

	I also don't use any of the ad-hoc features of Nix, so all system configuration is derived from my [nixfiles](https://github.com/ralismark/nixfiles).
	Which is pretty cool :)

2. Atomic snapshots of my data, for backups.
	I use [restic](https://restic.net/) to backup my persistent data to [backblaze b2](https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-storage) every fortnight.

# Software

- My window manager is **[SwayWM](https://swaywm.org)**, a wayland port of i3wm -- I don't have a desktop environment.
- My web browser is **[Firefox](https://firefox.com)** developer edition.
	You should use Firefox!
- My terminal is **[Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)**, configured [here](https://github.com/ralismark/nixfiles/blob/a9c72aa21b83a67d7f2476b026c17f786f67b3ea/home-manager/temmie-wattle/desktop-environment/alacritty.nix), though I am considering trying out wezterm.
	- The font is **[Cascadia Mono](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code)**.
- My text editor is **[Neovim](https://neovim.io)**, and my configuration (which requires nix) is in [this repo](https://github.com/ralismark/vimfiles).
	A cool party trick with this is that if you have nix, you can run neovim _with my configuration_ using
	```sh
	$ nix run github:ralismark/vimfiles#freestanding -- 
	```
- My shell is **[zsh](https://www.zsh.org)**, configured [here](https://github.com/ralismark/nixfiles/blob/a9c72aa21b83a67d7f2476b026c17f786f67b3ea/home-manager/temmie-wattle/programs/zsh/default.nix).
	I also somewhat wanna write my own shell one day.

	- I also have it set up so that when I open a terminal, I'm greeted with a cow saying a quote, e.g:
		```

		The cow part is **[cowsay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowsay)**, and the quotes are picked using **[fortune]** from my [quotes collection](https://github.com/ralismark/nixfiles/blob/main/assets/fortunes).

- My notes go in [ibis wiki](https://www.ralismark.xyz/ibis-wiki/), the notes app I made.
	Feel free to play around with it, but I would not recommend relying on it without asking me.
