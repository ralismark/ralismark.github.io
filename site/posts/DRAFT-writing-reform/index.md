excerpt: Or why you can never reform English or Chinese writing

I've recently been interested in linguistics, mostly from getting into the [Toki Pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona) community. While constructed languages and writing systems are quite cool and interesting in their own way, learning about linguistics has also revealed to me some things about real world languages.

# Some writing systems suck

Most English speakers would be aware of the inconsistencies in the English writing system that have accumulated over the centuries. There's the classic, but extremely contrived ["ghoti"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghoti):

- ⟨gh⟩ as /f/, as in "enough"
- ⟨o⟩ as /ɪ/, as in "women"
- ⟨ti⟩ as /ʃ/, as in "nation"

However, no one would actually pronounce it as /fɪʃ/. However, you *could* spell /fɪʃ/ as ["pfysche"](https://youtu.be/TEsqY4MH40s?t=25)[^1]!

[^1]: You can also make a distinction between the difficulty of trascription (sound to writing) and pronunciation (writing to sound). With English, transcribing a new spoken word isn't as difficult as figuring out the pronunciation of a written word. Chinese also has a ["character set" for transcription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_into_Chinese_characters), but the actual transcription process is a bit more involved than that.

Still, at least spelling is somewhat related to pronunciation! Compare this with the Chinese writing system, which I'm slowly learning. There's next to no correlation between characters and their pronunciation[^2], leaving you to memorise thousands of characters and their pronunciation and meaning.

[^2]: There are many characters composed of a radical to indicate meaning and another character for pronunciation, like 运 (yùn, "to ship") being composed of 云 (yún, "cloud"), which has no semantic relation, and 辶, the radical for walking or movement. So you can kind of guess the pronunciation of new characters, but not really.

!["Wiktionary entry for xíng. A large number of entries are shown, each stating that xíng is the Pinyin transcription of a different character"](/assets/xing2-homophones.png)
"Oops! All homophones"

Worse still, homophones are abound and there are characters whole pronunciations *change* in different contexts! Take [行](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%A1%8C#Chinese) -- normally pronounced xíng /ɕiŋ/ and meaning "acceptable", but also pronounced háng /xɑŋ/ and meaning "profession". That's pretty extreme though -- most characters have either only one pronunciation or a few that only differ by tone.

Not all languages are like this though. You have [shallow orthographies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthographic_depth), like Spanish, where spelling corresponds very closely to pronunciation.

# Can we do better?

Over the years, there have been numerous [spelling reforms proposed for English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-language_spelling_reform), with rarely any success. The only two notable attempts are Noah Webster's spelling changes which resulted in the American/British spelling divide, and the attempted but failed [SR1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SR1) here in Australia.

A major problem faced by those making English spelling more phonetic is the wide variety of English accents around the world. While usually mutually intelligible, people nonetheless pronounce the same word differently -- one such word is "tomato", pronounced with either /ɑː/ or /eɪ/. Do you spell it with "a"/"ah" or with "ei"?

Chinese writing faces a similar problem, being used by what is essentially a language *family* that are often not mutually intelligible -- Mandarin speakers like me can't understand Cantonese at all, despite both languages sharing a writing system.

Herein lies the curse of multi-dialect writing systems -- you can never achieve a writing system that corresponds with pronunciation perfectly, since there is no single pronunciation to correspond to.

# Good is the enemy of perfect

However, improvement is still possible, simply by being less strict on spelling correctness! For English, some unusually spelled words have been misspelled so much that these "mistakes" replace their original spelling -- words like "doughnut" becoming "donut" and "hiccough" becoming "hiccup".

Also, in many cases deviations between a language's spelling and pronunciation arise from pronunciation evolving much faster than spelling can update to match these changes. An interesting case of this can be seen in Pinyin, the standard romanisation system for Chinese, with the pronunciation of 二 (èr, "two") shifting to be pronounced more like "àr" while despite the Pinyin staying as "èr":

> In the recent decades, the vowel in the toned syllable "er" has been lowered in many accents, making the syllable come to approach or acquire a quality like "ar" (i.e., [äʵ] with the appropriate tone).

Unfortunately, there's not much that can be done for a logographic system like Chinese, where there's no correlation between a character's written form and its pronunciation.
