> Well, [it's public again]({% link _posts/2023-01-15-going-public.md %})!

I've been starting to add content that's more personal -- [my d&d 5e character]({% link _garden/5e.html %}), for an example that I'm still willing to share -- and as such, I'm making the source repo no longer publicly visible.

<!--more-->

The main motivation behind this was that having these files be easily *indexable* was making me a bit too nervous, though I'm okay with just having them be unlisted.

On the other hand, my static generation setup -- which I've documented in [my CI post]({% link _posts/2020-10-28-blog-ci.md %}) and [my general infrastructure post]({% link _posts/2021-01-08-blog-infra.md %}) -- is pretty unique so I still wanted that information, and particularly code, to be public. However, those blog posts document a good portion of what I've done. And I can somewhat easily just show the contents of useful files somewhere *\[update 2023-01-15: that used to link to a page that included and showed various files\]*.

Anyways, feel free to ask me about jekyll and stuff -- contact details are in the footer below.
