.. admonition:: warn

	For most of this post, there are no spoilers for the Return of the Obra Dinn.

	The one exception is in the last section.

	There will be a spoiler warning right before it.

	If you haven't played the game, seriously go and buy it and play it and discover the plot for yourself.
	It's definitely worth your time and money.

_The Return of the Obra Dinn_ is a fabulous game with wonderful soundtrack that immerses you so well in the narrative.
However, I play the violin.
I am intimately familiar with the sound of one.
And this:

That's not a real violin.

# What makes a violin sound real

The differences between a computer pretending to be a violin, and a real human playing a physical instrument, broadly fall into two categories.

The first is that the computer is not physically operating a violin.
This manifests in a number of quirks due to things like bow direction and what string is used, which normally cause audible differences.

One example of this is the staccato triplets at the start, and especially at 10s.
They are way too clean and identical.
The natural way to play those on an actual violin be something like up-bow, down-bow, up bow.
You'd get a slightly different sound (and probably volume) depending on the direction.
And doing them all in the same direction is possible but hard at that speed.

Also, all the notes are completely the same timbre!
The different strings on a violin sound different even when playing the same pitch!
This is why things like _sul G_ exist.

Also, though this is much less obvious in more professional players, you can't hear changes in bow direction or string.

The second kind of tell is that a computer has no emotion.
Having the entire orchestra there masks this somewhat through the sheer power of the sound, but if I pay attention to the violin solo part, it's really easy to tell how artificial and emotionless it is.
While this mostly stylistic variation in playing and whatnot, there are still some technical things.
The main one is the vibrato.
The vibrato on the long notes at around 20s are way too mechanical, with no variation at all across the entire duration of the note.
With how sustained it is, this was in fact the first tell for me.

# How to sell a fake violin

A while ago, I stumbled across this video on YouTube.

AZALI here has managed to take a completely digital violin and make it sound so much more realistic, which impressed me so much when I first heard it.
Especially the timbre change at 7s which sounds _exactly_ like if I did moved strings and played the same note as open string (or really any kind of string change).
There's also so much more variation in dynamics!
Which you'd get from a real bow!

> it's so crazy that there's also like the
> like the cresc. when you fuck up changing your bowing so u kinda swell

Though it does go a bit overboard at times.

Beyond that, there's the jank of what sounds like position changes.

Also, incredibly minor but a note at around 1:05 sounds slightly out of tune in such a realistic way.

# A real violin

All of this made me decide to record myself playing the violin solo part of that soundtrack.

It's bit rough at the moment since it's just recording -- I haven't cleaned it up at all yet.
Also I want to combine it with the rest of the orchestra, but I haven't found a version without the solo violin, and I'm not sure how to make on.

So if you do know how to please let me know :) I would really appreciate it.

I had way too many thoughts about this.
So here they are.

	There will be spoilers for **the plot of The Return of the Obra Dinn** until the end of the article!

	(I probably need to make this warning bigger so people don't accidentally scroll past it.

	So I'm just adding a bunch of filler text here lmao.

	Hope you enjoy this little intermission.)

So, a bit of context for this soundtrack.
The scene that it accompanies is during a Kraken attack.
At this point, less than half the crew is left after they were ravaged by other unholy beasts and everything before.
Rumours of a curse had been spreading around those that remained, and no one wants to remain on the ship.

Chronologically, a lot more follows, but it's one of the last scenes you encounter in the game.
You only get it after you've uncovered the entire plot and the fate of everyone on board.

With my rendition of the solo part, honestly, even after a few attempts at recording it -- I realised my regular vibrato is _way_ too wide and I had to tone it done from what was almost a trill -- the sound is nowhere as good as I would want, and so many problems stand out to my violinist ears.
But, rather than taking away from the music, the errors and the shakiness instead contribute to the hopeless and desperation.
The jank from all the string crossings and bow changes instead feel like voice cracks, almost like the pleading of the crew and likely also the captive beasts.

---

And so the captain goes, down into the depths of the ship, to confront the mermaids.
He sees his steward he had consigned to the lazarette, slumped against the chest with the shell on the ground.
His steward that had warned him about the beasts and their curse, and that he had ignored.

And sees that his steward was right.

And so, behind his rage towards the mermaids, is despair.

The realisation that ever since the unholy beasts were brought aboard there was no hope for them all.
