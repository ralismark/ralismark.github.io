The Inner West is the area of Sydney pretty much immediately west of the city.
While the northern and southern boundaries are pretty well-defined, being the Paramatta River and the Cook River, there aren't as clear boundaries for the east and the west.
I don't have any strong opinions about the eastern side, but with the western side I do, and that will be the focus of this post.

.. admonition:: aside

	Don't take this post too seriously :^)

The demographic of most of the Inner West is predominantly white people.
However, a (non-exhaustive) number of suburbs are different, with Asian culture having much more prevalence:

- Burwood
- Ashfield
- Strathfield
- Homebush[^homebush]

[^homebush]: I thought about this a bit more, and honestly Homebush feels more similar to suburbs on its west than Strathfield.
	So even though the A3 is a convenient place to draw the boundary between Olympic Park and Rookwood, the convenience is only geographic and not based on the vibe of the areas.

In this respect, these suburbs on the west have more in common with each other than with the rest of the Inner West (particularly the eastern side).
And so I don't think it makes much sense to draw the western edge anywhere through these suburbs.

	Don't you dare separate the two siblings that are Burwood and Strathfield.

This, however, puts the border in a somewhat awkward position.

The solution to this is very simple.

Make this cluster of suburbs is its own distinct region: the Midwest[^why-name].

[^why-name]: Yes, the name is a reference/joke about the [American Midwest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwest).

	The Midwest!
