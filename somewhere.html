  Spoilers!

  Looking at the source code will spoil things!

  For whatever reason I'm putting everything on the same page and using the URL
  fragment (the bit after the hash) to determine where you are. This avoids
  loading additional pages when you navigate around, but with the downside that
  I can't really hide anything.
