# Welcome!

<div class="h-card" markdown=1>

I'm **{{ site.me.name }}**{: .p-name } (she/her), but I usually go by **ralismark**{: .p-nickname } on the internet.

This website -- [ralismark.xyz](https://ralismark.xyz){: .u-url.u-uid rel="me" } -- is my canonical corner of the internet, where I [write irregularly]({% link posts.html %}), mostly on technical topics.

I'm [ralismark on GitHub](https://github.com/ralismark), and I toot as [{{ site.me.fedi.str }}]({{ site.me.fedi.url }}).
You can also email me via [tem@ this domain](mailto:{{ site.me.email }}).
<!--cloudflare email obfuscation means I can't u-email that last one-->

## whoami

- compsci student @ UNSW
- retired competitive programmer
- (previously) SWE @ algorithmic trading firm [Autumn Compass](https://autumncompass.com/)

I poke at a bunch of computing areas -- recently Nix, Rust, and contributing to Open Source.
I've also had experience with C++ & Go & bits of infra.

I also like making frontend things the old-school way with handwritten HTML/CSS and a touch of JavaScript.
This includes this website you're looking at, [some games] (try [this one]!), and [my personal wiki app].

[some games]: /webgames/
[this one]: /webgames/basalt-bashers/
[my personal wiki app]: /ibis-wiki/static/

Outside of tech, I play violin and am trying to memorise more Chinese, and I like learning about linguistics.
