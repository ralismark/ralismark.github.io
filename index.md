# Hi!

I'm **{{ site.firstname }}**, but I go by **ralismark** on the internet.
I'm a third year computer science student at UNSW, plus tutor/problem setter and dev.

I mainly work with C++ and Python and a smattering of other tech.
I'm also a fan of Rust and contributed [a][pr1] [few][pr2] [PRs][pr3] to [Tectonic Typesetting], a LaTeX engine in Rust &amp; C.
And I often do old-school web development in plain JavaScript -- such as [this website], [a game], and [a wiki].

[a game]: /webgames/basalt-bashers/
[a wiki]: /ibis-wiki/static/

I [write irregularly] about tech stuff I [look at and use], [competitive programming] and [other CS shenanigans], plus [probably][b1] [too][b2] [much][b3] on how this website and blog works.
