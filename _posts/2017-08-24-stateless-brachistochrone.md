excerpt: Determining if you need to decelerate without remembering where you started
---

Brachistochrone trajectories are the fastest path an object in space can take
from one point to another. In terms of movement, this involves continuously
accelerating until the halfway point, and slowing down for the rest of the
journey. It's trivial to calculate if you need to slow down if you have the
starting position; not so much if you don't.

<!--more-->

The basics of how the brachistochrone trajectory works is that you only start
slowing down at the latest possible moment. The time at which you switch turns
out to be exactly halfway, since the velocity gained speeding up must equal the
velocity lost slowing down. However, without the initial position, we can still
figure this out using the current velocity and position, as well as some
algebra.

Let $$x$$ be our position, $$v$$ be our velocity (both relative to the target),
$$t$$ be the time until the switchover, and $$A$$ be our maximum acceleration.

To figure out $$t$$, we be a bit sneaky. We find the point where the velocity is
the same on the other side of the switchover ($$p$$ here), and finding the
midpoint of the distance between them. The section is effectively a
mini-brachistochrone trajectory, but with everything moving at speed $$v$$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
	  t_{stop} &= {v \over A}
\\	         p &= {1 \over 2} A t_{stop}^2 = {v^2 \over 2A}
\\	x_{switch} &= {x + p \over 2} = {x \over 2} + {v^2 \over 4A}
\end{aligned}
$$

You can just use the sign of $$x_{switch}$$ to determine if you need to boost
forward of backwards [^1]. For most cases, this is sufficient. As extra, we can
solve for $$t$$ to determine how long until the switchover.

 [^1]:
	The comparison simplifies to $$2Ax + v^2 > 0$$, which is true if the
	switchover has not been reached.

$$
\begin{aligned}
	x_{switch} &= x - vt - {1 \over 2} At^2
\\	0 &= t^2({A \over 2}) + t(v) + (x_{switch} - x)
\\	t &= \frac{-v \pm \sqrt{v^2 - 2A(x_{switch} - x)}} {A}
\\	t &= \frac{-v \pm \sqrt{ {v^2 \over 2} + Ax }} {A}
\end{aligned}
$$

Even though there are 2 solutions (either plus or minus), we'll only want one of
those. As both $$v$$ and $$A$$ are positive, there'll only be 2 possibilities
for the signs of these solutions:

 1. One is positive, one is negative. This means that you haven't yet reached
    the switchover point. Take the positive one (the negative one is what we get
    if we reverse time).

 2. Both are negative. This means that you started slowing down too late. Still,
    for the time you missed the switch, take the higher one.

In both cases, we take the higher solution, leaving us with:

$$
t = \frac{-v + \sqrt{ {v^2 \over 2} + Ax }} {A}
  = t_{stop} + \sqrt{ {1 \over 2}t_{stop}^2 + {x \over A}}
$$
