This is the first post of the (hopefully long-lasting) blog. I'll be writing
about a significant range of topics, from very low-level (e.g. assembly) to more
higher level topics (e.g. web development), and much in between.

I started this since I had quite a few tech stories, and I thought, why not put
them on a blog? And here's the first post.

Not much more to it at this point.

## 2 Hard Problems

As once was said, one of the 2 hardest problems in computer science was naming
things, such as this blog. I didn't (and probably don't) have a good name for
this. For historical reference, at this point, it is called "triple except", and
was chosen arbitrarily. This came from the x86 triple faults (faults ==
exceptions), which was an [arbitrary article] [1] I found on Wikipedia.
