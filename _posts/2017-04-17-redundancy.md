You'll never know when your systems just stop working. This is why you have
multiple backups of your systems. Sometimes, more that you think. This is about
the extremely roundabout way I recovered some files from a system crash.

I'm at school, about to start working on a programming assignment. So I turn on
my laptop...and it doesn't turn on. Maybe force restarting (holding the button)
will fix it? Nothing.

At this point, I'm getting slightly worried, since I'll probably have to send it
to the service centre. Fortunately, I've just started doing full weekly backups,
and this occurred the day after the first one. So, if it does need to be
repaired, and the technicians decide to factory reset the device (for whatever
reason), I'll have a decently up to date copy of my data.

However, It'll still be a while until I can do that, and I need something to do
for an hour. There's no way of getting my full backup right now, so I look to my
other backups - OneDrive. I keep most of my files in OneDrive, which is synced
whenever anything changes. Additionally, it's usually accessible online. I would
be able to get this, except for another problem - the school proxy. For some
reason, the school's proxy blocks Microsoft services (e.g. OneDrive, Outlook,
etc.), so I'll need a way around this.

Here, $netsec enters. He has 3G, which effectively bypasses the proxy block. So,
using that as a hotspot, I download the files for the project. Fortunately, he
also has a copy of vim, which I also copy. I have my vimfiles on github (albeit
quite dated), which I download. With these I am able to continue working on the
programming project even without my computer.

Even though it's not a great story, this is why you should have redundant systems.

$netsec will likely come up again in future stories, since he is basically the
most experienced programmer (excluding myself) that I know. He is also quite
knowledgeable at networking and network security, much more than I, which is why
he's $netsec.
