excerpt: Using github CI to deploy to github pages.

While I've tried to keep this blog as static as possible, I've struggled with the limitations of github-pages for many features that I wanted to use.

- Biggest of all, you can't render $$\LaTeX$$ in jekyll and must include KaTeX or MathJax to render it client-side.
- Turning sections headings into links requires either doing it client-side or [parsing html with the Liquid templating system][jekyll-anchor-headings].
- Including GraphViz graphs (or other rendered diagrams) requires either generating them by hand, or automating it using a Makefile. Either way, you need to re-render the graphics by hand when you make changes.

Switching to github actions to build significantly relaxes these constraints. My current setup (shown below) involves spinning up a docker container and building the site there -- so I can test locally -- then automatically pushing to the `gh-pages` branch. It still uses Jekyll as the static site generator, so migration was quite painless.

With the full power of Jekyll, you can render $$\LaTeX$$ server-side by switching kramdown's math engine to [sskatex](https://github.com/kramdown/math-sskatex). You can also write plugins in the `_plugins` folder e.g. to run graphviz or add anchor tags to headers -- I've included both of these plugins below; check out Jekyll's docs for more info.

<details markdown="1"><summary>graphviz.rb</summary>

```ruby
module Jekyll
  class GraphBlock < Liquid::Block

    def render(context)
      text = super
      io = IO.popen("dot -Gbgcolor=transparent -Tsvg", "r+")
      io.puts(text)
      io.close_write()
      io.gets() # skip <?xml>
      io.gets() # skip <!doctype>
      io.gets() # skip end of doctype
      io.gets() # skip comment
      io.gets() # skip comment
      io.read()
    end

  end
end

Liquid::Template.register_tag("graph", Jekyll::GraphBlock)
```

<details markdown="1"><summary>markdown-header.rb</summary>

```ruby
module Jekyll
  class MarkdownHeader < Converters::Markdown
    def convert(content)
      super.gsub(/<h(\d) id="(.*?)">(.*)<\/h(\d)>/, '<h\1 id="\2"><a href="#\2">\3</a></h\1>')
    end
  end
end
```
