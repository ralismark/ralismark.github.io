excerpt: Using github CI to deploy to github pages.

While I've tried to keep this blog as static as possible, I've struggled with the limitations of github-pages for many features that I wanted to use.

- Biggest of all, you can't render $$\LaTeX$$ in jekyll and must include KaTeX or MathJax to render it client-side.
- Turning sections headings into links requires either doing it client-side or [parsing html with the Liquid templating system][jekyll-anchor-headings].
- Including GraphViz graphs (or other rendered diagrams) requires either generating them by hand, or automating it using a Makefile. Either way, you need to re-render the graphics by hand when you make changes.

Switching to github actions to build significantly relaxes these constraints. [My current setup][deploy.yml] involves spinning up a docker container and building the site there -- so I can test locally -- then automatically pushing to the `gh-pages` branch. It still uses Jekyll as the static site generator, so migration was quite painless.

[deploy.yml]: https://github.com/ralismark/ralismark.github.io/blob/d3ece19d62ed269817d3fcd397886e7f7c137547/.github/workflows/deploy.yml

With the full power of Jekyll, you can render $$\LaTeX$$ server-side by switching kramdown's math engine to [sskatex](https://github.com/kramdown/math-sskatex). You can also write plugins in the `_plugins` folder e.g. to [run graphviz][graphviz.rb] or [add anchor tags to headers][markdown-header.rb] -- check Jekyll's docs for more.

[markdown-header.rb]: https://github.com/ralismark/ralismark.github.io/blob/d3ece19d62ed269817d3fcd397886e7f7c137547/_plugins/markdown-header.rb
