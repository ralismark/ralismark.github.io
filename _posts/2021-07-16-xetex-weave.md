excerpt: I build the docs for XeTeX (and some other projects) so you don't have to
---

Pretty much as the subtitle says -- I spent most of today figuring out how to generate a nicely typeset pdf from `xetex.web`. Here's it is -- [XeTeX source documentation for v0.999992]({% link assets/xetex.pdf %})!

<!--more-->

I've also taken the opportunity to weave some more related files:

- [tangle v4.6]({% link assets/tangle.pdf %}), from <https://www.ctan.org/pkg/tangle>
- [weave v4.5]({% link assets/weave.pdf %}), from <https://www.ctan.org/pkg/weave>
- The original [TeX v3.14159265]({% link assets/tex.pdf %})
- [Îµ-TeX v2.6]({% link assets/etex.pdf %}) (using `weave tex.web etexdir/etex.ch`)
- [bibtex v0.99d]({% link assets/bibtex.pdf %}), from <https://ctan.org/pkg/bibtex> (I had to `sed 's/\\ETs/, and~/'` the .tex file to fix a compile error -- I think pdftex was somehow reading it as `\E Ts` due to there being a `\E` macro for exponentials)
- And [XeTeX v0.999992]({% link assets/xetex.pdf %}) from above

The build process for the most of these is just `weave <input.web> && pdftex <input.tex>`.

For some background, the original TeX code, as well as most of XeTeX, is written in Knuth's literate programming system [Web]. Web files are a mix of Pascal code (extracted using `tangle`) and TeX documentation (extracted using `weave`).

# Building

Here's how to build the XeTeX weave

- Clone the XeTeX repo with `git clone --depth 1 https://git.code.sf.net/p/xetex/code`[^green-download].
- If you don't already have `weave` -- which is distinct from `cweave`![^cweave] -- either get it from a pre-built TeXLive install, or build this project. There's no need to build if you already have `weave` though.
- Go to `source/texk/web2c/xetexdir`
- If you run `weave xetex.web`, you'll start getting errors. I've made a patch that fixes these errors -- see below.
- Run `weave xetex.web` -- the output should look something like this:

{: .wrap }
```
$ weave xetex.web

Writing the output file...*1*17*25*38*54*76*103*114*132*137*155*187*199*225*229*233*237*246*282*298*319*327*330*351*362*396*436*499*522*546*574*619*628*682*683*722*741*762*814*859*908*937*951*971*994*1019*1032*1081*1107*1188*1260*1351*1382*1390*1392*1449*1676*1677
Writing the index...Done.
(No errors were found.)
```

- Finally, run `xetex xetex.tex` to generate `xetex.pdf`.

[^green-download]: Don't download using the big green download button on the project summary page -- that gives you v0.9999.3 from 2013! Though that version builds without needing any syntax fixes.
[^cweave]: Thinking that `cweave` == `weave` caused a lot of headache with building, since you'll get a lot of errors if you use `cweave` instead of `weave`.

# Patch

Here's the patch that fixes the syntax errors for commit `bc89c789 Bump version to 0.999992 (targeted for TL'20).`
