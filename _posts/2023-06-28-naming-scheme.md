excerpt: "What I Name My Things"

My current naming scheme for machines is to use the names of native Australian plants, mostly taking from the [Flora of Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_of_Australia) Wikipedia page.
Right now, I just have:

- [wattle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acacia_pycnantha) is my laptop, my daily driver.
- [hakea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakea) is my phone.
- [banksia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banksia) was previously my router, mainly for a stable domain name for my home internet when doing port forwarding.
However, I haven't had a need for it after I started using cloudflared tunnel, and so the name is currently unused.

I previously used Greek letters, and kept a text document listing them.
However, that document is probably lost to time (or the poor organisation of my backups) now.

- Gamma for my phone I think?
Though the name wasn't actually used much, so I don't remember it as much
- Delta was my Dell laptop.
- Epsilon for a very slim USB I had, back when I still had a use for carrying a USB with me all the time.
- Zeta for my big chonky hard disk, that has since died.

I probably assigned Alpha and Beta to something but I don't remember anymore -- maybe it was like a Windows C:\ drive situation...

Interestingly enough, Wikipedia has a page on [Computer network naming schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network_naming_scheme), but there's not much content on it.
However, it did lead me to [RFC1178](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1178), guidelines on picking names, and [RFC2100](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2100), a cute poem about names.

Outside of naming electronic things, I recently discovered that many tech companies also give their meeting rooms names!
Both Canva and Google have rooms called Arvo, and one of the Sydney Atlassian offices has several named after songs, including _Never Gonna Give You Up_.
I heard a rumour that this trend of naming meeting rooms originally started in Google, but I don't know if this is true or not.

What names/naming schemes do y'all have for your things?

> I just remembered that for a brief period of time I used to name my software projects after _birds_.
> Unfortunately, this was very short lived since most computing things I start nowadays have more self-descriptive names.
> The only two things using this naming scheme were:
>
> - Heron, a static site generator library in Python that never really went anywhere.
> - [Ibis Wiki](https://ralismark.xyz/ibis-wiki/), my personal notetaking app -- and very much in active use by me (and recently rewritten to use React instead of some bespoke DOM manipulation).

> Bird names are pretty varies and are pretty cute and have personality so they're definitely a pretty good naming scheme!
