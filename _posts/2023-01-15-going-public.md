excerpt: We're back to being open source!
---

Around two and a half years ago I decided to take down the source code for my blog and make <https://github.com/ralismark/ralismark.github.io> private.
Well, now it's back to being public!
You can see all the behind-the-scenes stuff, including some content that I've taken down from the public website if you know where to look!

I originally make the source code private to make the hidden stuff inaccessible.
At the time I was pretty nervous about that, plus I think I was planning on using the website for more free-form webpages that don't fit this blog format.
But now, I don't think that first point is really true anymore, and I never really ended up doing much non-blog stuff.

However, the actual reason it's public again is more mundane -- on GitHub's free plan, you can't have private repos served on GitHub Pages.
I had Pro from being a university student, but that ran out and I didn't notice until I was wondering changes weren't being deployed.
Simply making it public again was the easy solution.
