Basically a "how did each article go".

# [Ownership Semantics for C programmers]({% link _posts/2021-05-10-ownership.md %})

- Pretty lengthy article, probably the first one that I spent multiple nights writing
  - Downside is that it's less coherent -- e.g. the parallel "affine type" and "uniqueness constraint" interpretations
  - Getting feedback was useful
- Concluding section as "Closing words" is cool
- Using named footnotes, rather than numbered, works better
- Code-wise, some innovative stuff
  - Inline comments. Preferable we get a better method, but this is good enough for now.
  - Whole-document postprocessing. In this case it was just a substitute, but more extensive stuff might be useful. Having it as an include works, but I would prefer having it in the preamble.

# [The Curse of Multi-Dialect Writing Systems]({% link _drafts/2021-01-28-writing-reform.md %})

- yeah, the dunning-kruger effect is really obvious here
