Many of these fall under the category of "things I that would be nice, but I wouldn't buy for myself" -- e.g. for books, this is because electronic copies typically cost less.

Firstly, you can buy me physical books that I can put on my shelf. In no particular order:

- [The Language Lover's Puzzle Book](http://www.alexbellos.com/language)
- [Toki Pona: The Language of Good](https://www.amazon.com/Toki-Pona-Language-Sonja-Lang/dp/0978292308)
- LessWrong-adjacent stuff like [A Map that Reflects the Territory](https://www.lesswrong.com/books), [Rationality A-Z](https://intelligence.org/rationality-ai-zombies/), and [Slate Star Codex Essays](https://www.amazon.com/Slate-Star-Codex-Essays-I/dp/1735797103)
- [The Fifth Science](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GTMYVZF)
- Other books! More physical books are nice, though note the environmental impact.

(That's also essentially an overview of my interests)

Secondly, you can buy me potted plants. I generally prefer ones which flower.
