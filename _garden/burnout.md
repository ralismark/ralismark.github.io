title: Burnout
---

I way came too close to burnout in March 2021.

Or actually hit burnout, I can't tell.

I was working part-time 3 days a week plus doing 2 uni courses -- MATH2111 and COMP3891. I was originally doing a third (COMP4141), but the workload from that, particularly the assignments, was a bit too much, so I (wisely) dropped a few days before census date.

Compared to some other cases of burnout, that's quite a low amount of work. Plus, I didn't feel too stressed at the time. But, turns out that my mental limits were *way* lower than I'd imagined.

You can my mental wellbeing reflected in the amount of Anki reviews I do each day.

Mental exhaustion was something I discovered immediately after I started work. Struggling to do anything remotely complex (e.g. reading a medium-length article or paper, programming), or an incredibly uneasy feeling in your head if you do try. By end, I was having a hard time talking after work, and occasionally getting executive dysfunction issues. Oh, also losing interest in your hobbies.

I also started getting mental problems. The most notable was having transient issues that I might've only been imagining (I've been internally calling them spurious symptoms), such as

- terrible memory recall
- feeling like I'm in a dream
- feeling like I just woke up from a dream, with the associated feeling of memory loss
- everything looking slightly dark
- various forms of detachment from reality
- a general sense that something is wrong with my brain

Anyways, let's talk about the last few days of this:

# Wednesday, March 24

I'm already a bit worn down, but I've got the EOS assignment 2 to do. So yeah, speedran it with my assignment partner that one day. Also had a meetup with a bunch of uni friends that night. By the time we finished the assignment at around midnight, I was completely mentally out. Still had some trouble sleeping.

# Thursday March 25

Work day. I don't remember much of this other than that I was just absolutely struggling to get through the day.

# Friday, March 26 - Sunday, March 28

Not much happened over the weekend. I tried to do some revision questions for MATH2111, with some degree of success. Got a nice amount of executive dysfunction. Being sleepy throughout the day but failing to actually fall asleep.

# Monday, March 29

Back to work. Again, my memory is fuzzy but I think I was relatively awake, barring the really high amount of spurious symptoms. After work, I took a nap. I woke up after 2.5 hours.

# Tuesday, March 30

Another work day. By this point I was pretty exhausted by the *start* of the day, and was making it through the day one hour at a time. Spurious symptoms again. On the way home, I got hit with some pretty bad anxiety (not sure about what), but it was only after that passed I realised that this was indeed burnout, and not just my brain being funky.

# Wednesday, March 31

I crashed hard. Completely mentally exhausted the whole day. Couldn't do anything more mentally challenging than talk on discord. But I had an math quiz -- auto-marked, no time limit, infinite retries (the combination of which was a absolute godsend) -- which was where the fun began: In my first attempt, after feeling recovered enough to comprehend math, I only managed to make it through 10 of the 19 questions before my mind gave out and I stopped being able to parse the questions. As such, I took a decent break of doing absolutely nothing before I came back and managed to stumble through the rest of them...

...at the cost of my language ability.

For some time afterwards, I was only able to produce really simple yet still not quite valid sentences typing to my friends on discord. Honestly quite an experience, but not one I'd like again any time soon.

# Afterwards

I took a day off on Thursday. Then, it's the long Easter weekend, so that's 6 days of nothing.

Well, turns out that I'm really bad at noticing when I'm close to mental exhaustion but not quite there yet. Plus, being active through the day -- particularly work -- masks whatever exhaustion I have. It was this effect that made me feel that my workdays were much more pleasant than my off days.

Also, I wasn't really that stressed in the grand scheme of things. My job didn't have hard deadlines or was unpleasant. Nor did I think I was pushing myself too hard -- I have pretty hard limits.

Honestly, if I had a better sleep schedule I might've been fine, but alas, consistently going to sleep anything before midnight, let alone something reasonable like 10 or 11, is a Hard problem. Plus, I wake up halfway through the night if I sleep too early.
