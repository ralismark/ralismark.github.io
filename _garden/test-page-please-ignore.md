This is a short admonition.

{% include admonition %}
> hello there

This is a long admonition.
I'm having a bunch of text here so I can test the right margins.

{% include admonition %}
> Suppose you want to determine whether a star is a giant.
> A giant star has a large extended photosphere.
> Because it is so large, its atoms are spread over a larger volume.

And this is text afterwards

> and this is a regular blockquote

> ![]({% link assets/spiral.svg %}){: width="64" height="64" }
> cool tem's hot tip

> I guess you can copy Amos now?
