> Elenari Koselu, Warlock Eladrin

# Traits

- Elen has less regard for their own safety, mostly because they're pretty confident in their own ability to not mess things up. I guess this transfers to memory loss periods? More generally, less worried and careful about things.
- Still thinks they're a(n aspiring) wizard and not a warlock. Because, well, they haven't recognised the signs that they're a warlock, and it's very distinct from more the common deliberate pacts.
- Occasionally find themselves staring off into space -- they're actually chatting with patron (like mental telephone). Why not during their nightly trance? ~~Because timezones~~
- Values knowledge and research
- People helped them a bunch in the past (I haven't figured this out yet, DM feel free to fill this in lmao), and Elen values helping others in a "pay it forward" kind of manner.

# Backstory

- (stuff about character growing up. Very much not rushed because, well, elves)
- At some point, they decide to enrol in magic uni to get a more comprehensive & formal understanding of magic. <!--why?-->
- Following along alright
- One night, Elen was looking around the library <!--what does this say about them--> when they come across a dusty old tome that's *very* out of place <!--ooh plot hook! Who put this tome here?-->
- They have a look through it. It's written in the Elvish script but a different language, so they borrow the book (librarian: "It's not in the catalogues, so I guess just take it?").
- Elen goes off and learns Sylvan. <!--some reason for doing this instead of consulting people who are already familiar? 1. no rush, 2. it's a useful thing as well-->
- After learning just enough to decipher parts of the mysterious book, but not enough to realise what it's about, they accidentally trigger a pact. Elen wakes up a few hours later, feeling very disoriented and with the book gone except for a few torn-out pages and some handwritten notes <!--something about these torn out pages-->.
- Over the coming months, they gradually start figuring out warlock powers. From this, Elen discovers that they now have quite a bit of magical intuition and starts to breeze through uni courses. They also starts to run into some of the safety rules in the more practical courses to stop careless students from harming themselves or others.
- Honestly, just gets annoyed enough to eventually drop out. Plus, they're not learning as much now, due to becoming a warlock (even though they don't know about it much)
- This whole time, has been having occasional memory loss incidents and every so often hears patron's voice in their mind, but how often this occurs is very variable.
- But yeah, hasn't told anyone about this because others think it's heckin weird.

# Extra notes

- Elen doesn't know who their patron is
- What does the patron gain from this? Is there like an overarching plan (and if so, how much does Elen know), or is it just for their amusement?
- Who places the pact book in the library? (Potential plot hook: meeting that person, finding what their intentions are, how they acquired it, if they're connected the patron)
- There's a lot of time before uni life that I haven't thought out, so you've got lots of years to play with I guess. I've listed in Traits that Elen wishes to pay any help they receive forward and help others.
- I haven't really thought much about what the pages left from the book are.
