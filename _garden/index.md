Hey there! You've stumbled across the more hidden part of my website. The content here will be more varied and unpolished and personal, and usually doesn't belong in the [main blog]({% link posts.html %}). For this reason (well, mainly the fact that it's more personal and private), I've intentionally made it difficult to look around.

Please be nice. Thanks. And may you find what you're looking for.

Here's some things here:

- [Some short book reviews]({% link _garden/booklist.md %})
- [Figuring how to join2 binary trees]({% link _garden/treap.md %})
- [My d&d 5e character]({% link _garden/5e.html %})

Also, did you know about these pages?

- [A single file with every single blog post]({% link everything.html %})
- [Licensing info & attributions]({% link licenses.md %})
