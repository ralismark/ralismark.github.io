(Accurate as of 26 Jun 2021)

**Pronouns:** default to they/them. Use she/her if you want to be spicy (in a good way). Never use he/him.

**Name:** My new name is *Teresa*, though I'm still getting used to this. You can still call me *Tim* or *Timmy* and I'm currently still okay with that, though that may change in the future. For other nicknames and such, ask me first -- my rough estimate is that I'll be okay with it if it's not masculine.

**Other:** Do not use masculine terms when referring to me.
