You reach the base of a mountain.
The ground begins to slope up ahead, and the dirt path transitions into a staircase that crawls and weaves its way up between the trees, eventually disappearing into the fog and clouds.

An individual in purple robes greets you and introduces himself as Autumn.
Besides him stands a signpost, announcing the route as "{{ scram(20) }}, 1ly"

_"Is this where you're going?"_, he asks, looking up the steps.

There's a small tree a bit further up the path, ahead of the treeline.
It's decorated with ribbons and notes that wave gently, as if saying _farewell_ and _good luck_.

_"Blessings left by those who embark on the climb.
A tradition"_, Autumn elaborates.

_"Good luck, I know you can do it"_
