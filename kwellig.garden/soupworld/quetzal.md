title: The Fable of the Quetzal
---

In a faraway forest, there was a Quetzal that lived with his many bright feathered friends.

One day, Quetzal had to go to the plains for (something).
He flew for one whole day and one whole night, passing rivers and mountains, before he found the plains, where he was greeted by Hare, Rabbit, and Weasel.
These would be his new friends while he was here over summer.

The plains are a land of earthy colours, of browns and faded greens, and Quetzal, with his brilliant greens and reds, stood out no matter everywhere he went.
Even when with Hare, Rabbit, and Weasel, he would get looks of surprise and wonder from passerbys.
Some would even come up to ask him about his homelands!

But Quetzal was a quiet fellow, and did not like the questions.
So he began to hide his feathers under a big grey coat.
It made him not able to fly, but that was something he was willing to sacrifice for a bit of peace.
