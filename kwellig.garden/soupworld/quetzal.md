title: The Fable of the Quetzal
---

.. poem::

	In a faraway forest, among rainbow flowers and emerald trees,
	there was a brilliant green bird -- Quetzal was he!
	He'd fly with his feathered friends across the sky, singing out their melody,
	and in their wake would be a chorus of chords, ringing out in harmony.
	And when the sun took its leave, and when the clouds wept, they'd bring out their tune
	and paint the flowers and the sky all colours from violet to maroon.
	_Showing the world how to be vibrant and light, teaching it how to croon._

	But one day the plains whispered his name, and so Quetzal had to go.
	Flying a week and its nights, over mountains and their snow,
	following rivers and valleys, over where divine beasts roam,
	drifting through clouds, crossing the sky all alone,
	_until he was so, so, so far from home._

	And he reaches the plain, this flat sea of shrubs and grass,
	and the grounded mammals he's with until this season would pass.
	So different from his home of blues and red, in which colour pervades,
	this is the land of browns and greys. Earthy shades.

	And like how his brilliant colours didn't belong,
	with no one else who knew it, neither did his song.
	No harmony to be found, no tunes around.
	Only a steady rhythm of hoofs against the ground.

	And so he sung along -- for him, what choice was there?
	And that's if he would even dare.
	Who was he to sing, if no one would listen or care?
	If no one wanted what he wanted to share?

	And as he lost his song, he lost his colour.
	A once brilliant coat, faded, now duller.
	And as his feathers lost their sheen,
	they became frayed and damaged, too brittle to preen.

	His feathers no longer desired to keep him aloft,
	so much of who he was, was now becoming lost.
	The song in his soul replaced by the tones of the plain --
	a bird of the rainbow forest, he struggled to remain.

	Time would pass, for him almost too long,
	but one day his flock came with their song!
	A song he hadn't thought of in a while --
	a novel tune for this place, a different style.
	Reminding him of who he was since he'd started to forget.
	And of their song with the world, that great duet.
	Reminding his coat of their vibrance and their sheen,
	his feathers of what they had been.
	_Reminding his soul of his forest, and its trees of emerald green._

	Restored now, himself whole once more,
	he could open his wings and begin to soar,
	_spreading a vibrance to replace the dullness from before._
	Sprouting flowers among the scrubs, colours red, green, and blue.
	And a few mammals too, mottled with a different hue.
	_And finally this brilliant green bird soared, colouring the sky at dusk anew!_

	.. details:: Original narrative draft

		In a faraway forest, there was a Quetzal that lived with his many bright feathered friends.

		One day, Quetzal had to go to the plains for (something).
		He flew for one whole day and one whole night, passing rivers and mountains, before he found the plains, where he was greeted by Hare, Rabbit, and Weasel.
		These would be his new friends while he was here over summer.

		The plains are a land of earthy colours, of browns and faded greens, and Quetzal, with his brilliant greens and reds, stood out no matter everywhere he went.
		Even when with Hare, Rabbit, and Weasel, he would get looks of surprise and wonder from passerbys.
		Some would even come up to ask him about his homelands!

		But Quetzal was a quiet fellow, and did not like the questions.
		So he began to hide his feathers under a big grey coat.
		It made him not able to fly, but that was something he was willing to sacrifice for a bit of peace.

		.. poem::

			In a faraway land was a brilliant green bird -- the Quetzal.
			He lived with his colourful feathered friends up in the trees,
			and when it rains, together they sang a colourful melody.
			And each one's tune would paint the sky and flowers.

			But one day, the plains called for him, and Quetzal had to go.
			Flying a day and a night, over mountains and rivers,
			until he found the plains and was greeted by a hare and a weasel.
			These would be his friends for the season.

			You see, the plains are a land of earthy shades, of browns and faded yellows.
			Not a land of red and brilliant greens.
			Quetzal was all alone, with no one who knew his tune.
			His song was not a solo one, but there was no band to accompany him.
			Only the rhythm of hoofs and paws.

			And so he sung along, no more playful chirps.
			Instead replaced by longer tones, a rumble, a growl.
			And that's if he even made a sound at all.

			And as he lost his song, he lost his colours.
			Brilliant shades fading to drab and dry.
			The mammals of the plain saw him as one of their own.
			And with it, he gained a sickness -- his feathers crinkled and bent.
			And debated whether to keep him aloft.

			But one day, his colourful friends came to say hi.
			Bringing their melody that Quetzal hadn't heard in a while.
			He needed a while to remember the tune,
			but when he did his colours returned.
			And when they did his feathers remembered their role
			And that brilliant green bird could colour the sky once more.

			A brilliant coat, fading, now duller.
			Washed out and bleached. Muddier. Greyer.
			........................

			With his feathered friends of every colour, he'd fly
			And sing a melody, ............ they'd dye

			...

			But one day the plain called for him, and Quetzal had to go.
			He flew a day and a night, over mountains and their snow.
			Following rivers and crossing biomes,
			until he was so far from home.

			He finds the plains, flat sea of shrubs and grass,
			and the grounded mammals, his friends until the season would pass.
			So different from that world of reds and yellows,
			this is a land of faded browns and greens, earthy shades -- much more mellow.

			His song he had sang, in the plains it wasn't known.
			With no more chorus, the chords became a single tone.
			And no one heard -- among the sounds of the plain it drowned
			leaving only a steady rhythm of hoofs and paws against the ground.
