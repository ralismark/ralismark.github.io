After eons, the Slobbering God has finally grown weak.
She is no longer the divine beast She used to be, no longer the divine beast whose name would strike terror into our hearts.
Because, together we have slain Her.

It marks a change in era.
We used to live under the chilling presence of the divine beasts that dictated the rules of world.
One where you huddled together to survive, where you might wonder if you'd wake up the next day.
But in recent years their power has waned, the scales tipping back to us little folk.
The world is still dangerous - the divine beasts still roam the land, and Her mark on the world will still remain for your lifetime, if not generations to come.
But we have a strength now, a hope in our hearts...

Spring has come at last!

This is a bit of new lore I want to put into Soupworld!
Making it a world of larger-than-life powers that you need to respect, but at a turning point in the world, where the pockets of civilisation that have endured that for centuries can now start to blossom again and reconnect.

The Wanderhome influence on this should be pretty clear -- Slobbering God is directly taken from it, but it's also a frame that you can fit the Rebellion into.
After all, Soupworld was originally (and still somewhat is) intended as a world for a Wanderhome campaign.
And the dangers that lie between pockets of society also centres _journeys_ as a pretty central part of the world.

But the biggest inspiration is actually this video about the Bronze Age Collapse!

The part about how the Illiad and Odyssey were culminations of centuries of oral tradition passing down history and culture across an entire era, finally being able to reconnect with all the fragments of civilisation that clung on across this time... it's definitely a vibe!

(I also just recently finished listening to [Epic: The Musical]... that probably played a part)

That specific inspiration lines up pretty well with the Poet playbook as well!
