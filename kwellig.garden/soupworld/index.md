Hi there, and welcome to _Soupworld_, a kitchen sink world that's a playground for me to rotate ideas and be creative in!

# Where this all started...

.. admonition:: me/say

	brain blast

	5e is to c++\
	as\
	wanderhome is to Haskell

.. admonition:: me/say

	explanation of this

	5e is popular. it's also like fundamentally cooked in so many ways. i keep trying to fix it (trying to be dm, the rotating dm idea, accidentally trying to port pf2e to it) when the actual answer is that i should just play wanderhome

.. admonition:: me/say

	(also pf2e is rust)\
	(pf2e fills the same ttrpg space as 5e but fixed a lot of the fundamental problems)

.. admonition:: me/say

	maybe i should just port all my little guys to wanderhome and disappear from the society campaigns

	wait can you singleplayer wanderhome

.. admonition:: me/say

	i just wanna make up funny stuff

	i think the reason i keep coming back to 5e is that i don't need to come up with a set of mechanics for how things work

	wait i should just go do worldbuilding independent of ttrpgs

.. admonition:: bee/say

	we did it, temmie discovers writing again
