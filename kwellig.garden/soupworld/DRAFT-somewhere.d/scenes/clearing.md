With a _plop_, you find yourself in a small clearing bathed in soft golden light!

A layer of comfortable moss carpets the hard ground, occasionally interspersed with small flowers.
You hear the sounds of chirping birds and rustling leaves in the distance.

.. details:: Sit for a bit.

	You sit down on the greenery,and run your hands over it.
	It's cool and soft.

	You feel well rested.

There's something calming about this environment -- you feel safe here.
But everything under the light seems to sparkle, just a little bit, and you can't get the thought out of your mind that this place was not designed for you.

At a distance, encircling the clearing are number of worn stone walls and pillars.
Covered in vines, they look ancient.
They stretch up and disappear into the fog above, concealing the sky (or ceiling... where is the light coming from?)

- [Walk past them.](#clearing:outside)

Stood up around this clearing are a few freestanding doorways.
