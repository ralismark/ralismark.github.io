# Magic

Magic is local, that's what makes it magic.
If something's everywhere, it's mundane, so all magic has _exceptions_.



# Stars

Stars are "magical" from our perspective, but they're treated as mundane in-universe.






















# Divinity

There are no powerful gods.
They got out of control.
They fought.
**We slew them.**

Now, **all gods have LIMITS**:

- All gods are LOCAL.
	No god can be everywhere all at once.
	They can only do things within their domain, and only learn of things within their domain.
- All gods have a DOMAIN.
	No god can be responsible for everything.
	Just as a person has interests, they too have a small number of aspects of the world they care about.
	Within their domain, they can try influence things, just a little.
- All gods are IMPERFECT.
	No god is infallible.

There is not a god for everything.
There are places, things, and concepts under the purview of no god.

Other than gods, there are stars.
They cannot do anything themselves, except act as a guide.

# Land

So, this world is broadly based on Canada lmao.
The geography and climate is different and I make creative liberties where I please, but the layout of water features and major settlements will likely be inspired by Canada.

We start off in the very east coast in Nova Scotia.
