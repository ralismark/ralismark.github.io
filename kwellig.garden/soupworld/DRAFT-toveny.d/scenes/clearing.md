The passage opens up, into a large, round cavern.
No surface is left uncovered by the pitch-black gum, whose every inch is now interspersed with yellow spots of all different sizes, from no larger than a speck of dust to clumps larger than a fist.
Their previously fuzzy glow now combines into almost a golden fog, obscuring the number of black viney tendrils, hanging from the ceiling and reaching up from the ground.

_"Welcome, my child,"_
breathy words drift from the centre of the space.

The first thing that catches your eyes, is a pair that stare back at you.
Two golden rings, rich irises around inky pupils, on a head tilted at an angle.
Observing you blankly and unblinkingly, yet with no sign of suspicion or malice.

Your eyes adjust to the blackness and begin making out more and more details.
The figure's upside-down body.
Their long wiry hair floating down beneath them.
Tendrils wrapping around their waist and a leg, securely holding them aloft but not restraining.

And as you match their stare and make out more of their expression, you get the sense that it's a look of... shared sympathy.
_I know what it took for you to be here_.

It gives a weak smile.

"You've grown a lot"
