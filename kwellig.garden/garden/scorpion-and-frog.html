title: Scorpion and Frog
---

<p>
	A scorpion, not knowing how to swim, asked a frog to carry it across the river.
	"Do I look like a fool?" said the frog.
	"You'd sting me if I let you on my back!"
</p>
<p>
	"<del>Be logical</del><ins>Do you know how rude that is?</ins>", said the scorpion<ins>, offended</ins>.
	"<del>If I stung you I'd certainly drown myself.</del><ins>You don't appreciate how much effort I've put into stinging less!</ins>"
</p>
<p>
	<ins>The frog shifted warily, and opened its mouth to protest.</ins>
</p>
<p>
	<ins>The scorpion continued, "--and you should be less tense. This is not how friends are to each other, your attitude is making me worried about you!"</ins>
</p>
<p>
	"That's true," the frog acknowledged<ins>, pushing the fear wrapping around its heart deep, deep down</ins>.
	"Climb aboard, then!"
</p>
<p>
	But no sooner than they were halfway across the river, the scorpion stung the frog, and they both began to thrash and drown.
	<del>"Why on earth did you do that?" the frog said morosely.
	"Now we're both going to die."</del>
</p>
<p>
	"I can't help it," said the scorpion.
	"It's my nature."
</p>
<p>
	<ins>"What did I do wrong?" thought the frog, its lungs rapidly filling with water.</ins>
