title: On Why I Moved Out
---

This is the story of why I moved out of Kensington, written up for once so I don't have to keep repeating it.

I moved out of my parents place to a unit in Kensington around October 2021, with Frank and Luke.
Due to various things, Luke moved out in mid 2022, and we found Neel to replace him.
Now, immediately from the start I got bad vibes from Neel.
I initially chalked it up to just unfamiliarity, but the feeling of like anxiety never really went away.

In retrospect I can see that it was pretty well-founded.
Our relationship felt really one-sided in that he was _incredibly_ assertive -- I'm the completely opposite and really non-confrontational -- and I didn't like being around him because of that.
And also, he's that kind of really self-confident guy (if you know what kind of person I'm talking about then yeah it's not great).
Plus, his tone of voice is just generally really serious which spooked me even more.
There were also a couple of red flags.
For one:

> I'm also not willing to out of the way to change myself - I hope you understand.
>
> --- Neel

Another was him talking to me about philosophy a couple of times, where he was being a devil's advocate and questioning my beliefs, I think in an attempt to make me make sure they're well founded.
Which is uncalled for, and not something I really wanted.

But yeah, in general Neel was seriously making me on edge, to the point where I was getting noticeable flight-or-flight responses.
Like I honestly started not feeling safe being at home with Neel.
I did not want to be in his presence at all for fear of doing something that would make him getting mad at me.

(This is also why I can't stand being called Tems, since that's what Neel called me)

There were some other hostilities as well, such as Neel and Frank planning house parties without letting me know at all -- like seriously one night people just started showing up and I was really confused until I gathered that we were having a house party.
There were a couple of other cases of them planning stuff behind my back, since Neel and Frank got along really well, far better than me with either of them.

Anyways, I just wanna mention that I was also kinda a shitty housemate, mostly with respect to keeping the kitchen clean.
I really tried, and I felt like I got better over time.
But there would always be something I missed, or forgot about.
My defence is that I was severely burnt out the whole time I was living there, and making me like really forgetful and whatnot, but I know that that's not really an excuse.
I have no idea how bad I was actually in absolute terms, I don't know if I was the bad person in this story or not.
I'd like to think that I was not.

We've had a cockroach problem for a decent amount of the time I was living there.
Neel and Frank both believe that it's because I haven't been keeping the countertops clean, while my hypothesis was that it was because of our bins in the kitchen sitting around.
Though one cause we did find was a pack of biscuits in the pantry that wasn't sealed properly and was really feeding the cockroaches.
I proposed a solution of having the bins outside but that was kinda shut down by them -- they kept mentioning how annoying it was to have it outside, it felt really passive aggressive (but maybe that's just me being scared :sob:).
And yeah, I don't think I denied cleanliness accusations much because that's how I am, I don't really deny accusations of any sort.

Also we didn't have proper flyscreens and had to kinda make do with the removable ones.
This was a problem because the one in the kitchen would regularly fall down.
As such, when Neel and Frank went to Japan for a holiday while I was interning at Canva, we started having a fly problem that I was way too burnt out to really do much about.
I was just really overwhelmed by this issue and I couldn't do much to try and address it.

The main thing that catalysed the events that led to me leaving was our rent increasing from $650 to $800 -- $50 each.
That led to this exchange:

Neel:

> Hey Tems, sorry for the delay and not being more transparent about that, but we've been doing some planning on our own, and were hoping to bring this up to you after we had all our thoughts and plans together.
> Yes, we have been thinking of seriously moving out of the house given the rent increase, the existing cockroach problem, and the overall lack of maintenance around the house.
> In light of what you've said, it is the unfortunate fact of the matter that there are 2 ways this can go.
> Either:
>
> 1. Frank and I leave, and you risk Dennis kicking you out.
> 2. You leave yourself and Frank and I stay handle find a 3rd housemate.
>
> However, in case 2, you will have help.
> Frank and I have discussed, and we're prepared to help you find a new place to stay.
> If you let us know what you look for in a house and when you're free, we can do some of the searching, and set up inspections for you.
> When the time comes, we may even be able to help you with moving your stuff out of the house, if needed (2 extra lads makes moving out well over 3 times less painful, trust me).
> We're happy to support you in any other way you require.
> This is opposed to you having to do the whole thing yourself, or having to find other people to sign the lease with.
>
> As for us, money and locations are both serious considerations.
> We don't exactly make heaps, or have massive stockpiles lying around, and I'll be a student for the rest of this and next year so I can finish both my degrees, so being close to UNSW is important.
> All the people we're considering to have move in are also tight-fisted uni students, so the location and rent is important for them too.
> You however are not bound by these restrictions, so you are free to stay somewhere that's not in the randwick/kensington area, like somewhere better connected to the city and your parents.
> Or at the very least, the new place won't come infested with cockroaches.
> And, you'll have 1 dude with free time (Frank) and another with plenty of house hunting experience (me) to help you out.
> How does that sound?
>
> In either one of the 2 ways it plays out, you either have the uncertainty of having to move out with no help at all, or having to handle signing on 2 new housemates and dealing with Dennis, or have the known certainty of moving out with 2 people's willing help.
>
> I believe it is in everyone's interest here that we go with option 2.

I replied with some stuff that Frank then responded to:

> > i don't see why me leaving will allow you to address your concerns with the current place, particularly the rent increase that seems to be primary motivation for this.
>
> our concerns are not so much with the increase but more with it being so disgusting to live here despite it being talked about multiple times with multiple roommates, primarily stemming from your relaxed cleaning habits
>
> > i appreciate that you're willing to help for option 2, but this feels like an ultimatum, particularly with how none of this has been discussed with me given how much it would affect me.
> > to be honestly, i don't see why the onus is on me to leave
>
> it's not on you, you can choose to stay and we leave but like you said, your friend got kicked out which feels shitty if we're the cause of it and you've basically left us no choice but to want to move out
> but if you want to not risk that and leave on your own terms then you can and we'll offer you some help if you do
>
> > if you two have a problem with me please let me know
>
> we have let you know and little to nothing has changed, it was talked about with Luke and nothing changed and he ended up moving because of it. I speak for both me and Neel here.

And so I told them this:

> i feel like you two have reached a conclusion on this matter, and while i have objections (for one, i think i just haven't really communicated what i have done), i don't think that's a discussion worth having.
> either way, there's definitely quite a bit of resentment i don't think we can resolve with our current arrangements.
> I'll let you know when I've decided on what the plan is going forward, but i similarly don't feel comfortable staying with you two so i think this is a good opportunity for us to split.

I moved out soon after this exchange.

The person to replace me was Joshua Tan (yeah, the arc delegate of string ensemble).
So yeah, personality-wise he fits in pretty well.
