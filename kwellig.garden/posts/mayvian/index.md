_It was 24th of March._

_I don't know where I am.
Or why.
All I know is that I'm being chased.
By someone, or something.
And if they catch me.
Something terrible will happen to me._

_An overwhelming sense of fear envelopes me.
I scramble over park benches and tables in an attempt to get away._

_Something changes.
(As they do in these places.)
With a thought, my body morphs into a much smaller form.
Fitting in with the others of my kind at a park table, whatever's chasing me loses track, giving me a moment of respite._

_I stay for a moment.
Red leaves blown by a errant gust rustle around me.
A sunflower seed is eaten off the table._

_I can tell it's found me again.
Following instincts that came with the altered form, I spread my limbs and take to the skies.
They know the subtle twists and adjustments of this dance, their muscle memory as innate and unthinking as that of walking._

_Boundless joy.
The purest essence of freedom, raw and untamed.
Everything is suddenly okay, not a thing in the world could keep me down._


_I'm free again, if only for just a moment.
Out of the corner of my eye I spot my jet-black feathers, covering my entire body._

...

Everything starts losing focus, blending together, as if a watercolour dipped in a river.

...

I feel my human body again.
The weight of my arms and legs and body on a bed, the weight of blankets on me.
And even as morning turns into afternoon into night, and days pass, the dream[^dream]'s impression on my heart remains.

[^dream]: In a way, the dream was just the culmination of several weeks of sporadic nightmares of being chased by some mysterious entity and being absolutely terrified, plus dreams where I could fly by doing something silly with my human body.

	Not long after the events here both of these stopped...

I haven't thought about birds the same ever since, I love them so much!
They're everywhere and they're so incredibly cool and interesting!!

I may be _just_ a little obsessed.[^malleability]

[^malleability]: My personality tends to be quite malleable, and that fateful dream took _full_ advantage to make birds a core part of my identity.
	Definitely started identifying with the Australian raven (the primary corvid in Sydney) a bit, basically the avian equivalent of a furry :p

	...but the incredibly euphoria of being carrried away by this obsession began to fade after two weeks.
	I was a bit sad for it to go, but a friend gave me some good advice:
	{# https://discord.com/channels/692945454601601095/1070623310674673684/1361328615781957884 #}
	"Simply make the conscious choice for birds to be your thing and then the obsession will return. It may be a quiet, calmer obsession, but it will be an obsession nonetheless."

	And here we are, months later, and birds are still a big thing for me :)

I wish I could do what I did in that dream, in real life.

# Mayvian

For the month of May I set myself an art challenge I called **Mayvian** (may-avian), in which I drew a bird every day of the month.
It's a bit of a serious parody on those "art prompt a day for a month" challenges, except every day is "bird", but someone that's quite a newbie to drawing it's been wonderful!
I ended up having a days were I couldn't draw for various reasons, so it ended up being a challenge to simply draw on 31 days, which I completed... just before the end of June.

_Mayvian_ was inspired by _STARCH_, a joke art challenge by a friend in which you draw a potato every day of March.

.. figure:: {{ recipe.copy_ca("./starch.png") }}
	:alt: "Starch: Draw every day of March with a prompt", followed by a numbered list of prompts for each day. Every single prompt is just "potato".

	He actually did it, and followed it up with a sequel, "_APEril_", though unfortunately that didn't end up happening.

Much later I discovered [_Avian August_](https://www.tumblr.com/cookiedoves/788604186710392832), a yearly art challenge run by [@cookiedoves](https://cookiedoves.carrd.co/) -- their art is also really cool, go have a look!
Main difference being that there's a specific bird each day -- this year they're all Hawaiian birds -- whereas I was just drawing whatever bird I felt like :p

# Practice Makes Perfect

One of the best things about doing a month-long art challenge like this when you're a beginner is how it shifts your priorities from _quality_ to _quantity_.
There's this popular parable around about learning through quality.
It apparently originating in the book [Art & Fear](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0961454733/); here's the part that gets circulated around:

> _The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups.
> All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality.
> His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the "quantity" group: fifty pound of pots rated an "A", forty pounds a "B", and so on. Those being graded on "quality", however, needed to produce only one pot — albeit a perfect one — to get an "A"._
>
> _Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity.
> It seems that while the "quantity" group was busily churning out piles of work – and learning from their mistakes — the "quality" group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay._

I definitely noticed this in _Mayvian_ -- you could see the improvement over the month.
I think one of the big reasons for is that, when your goal is to just show up for 31 days and just draw something, you're much less worried about doing something well.
Everything is way less intimidating and lower stakes and I'm worrying less about being perfect, which actually resulted in me being generally pretty happy with how things looked -- [a friend talked about this on his blog a couple years back](https://violetteahouse.com/posts/paradox-of-drawing-well/)!

Mistakes are way less scary too -- if you mess up, there's always tomorrow to give it another go!
This happened on day 10 with the crow, where I tried a different pose for it initially, couldn't figure it out, and so I tried again from scratch.
But I counted both attempts towards the 31!

Regular drawing like this presents a really nice feedback cycle as well, for building confidence and getting over the "oh I'm not good enough to draw that" anxiety.
Mistakes from one day become lessons you can apply in later days.
And you also uncover your strengths too!
I kept surprising myself with how well my drawings were turning out.

Besides, having such a large volume of art, especially one that shows your progress, is straight up really cool :)

# Birds Of A Feather

Another part of drawing I ended up quite liking is researching the anatomy of birds!
The biggest part was learning all the details about the feathers and muscles and bones that make wings work, and marvelling at their homology with human arms ("this one here's the hand! and that one's the forearm!").
There were many days where, in service of an attempt to draw half-open wings, I sat in a park and just watched the ibises open and close their wings.

This later leaked into TTRPGs, of course, with my making of a new character.
I decided to make them be of an avian species, and I soon came to realise how picky I was with the design of their upper limbs:
No arms in addition to wings ("have you never heard of tetrapods???"),
no hands that are too human either!
They should have claws!

.. admonition:: me/say

	And don't get me started on [characters using feathers as digits](https://zeldawiki.wiki/wiki/File:BotW_Revali_Concept_Artwork.png)...

My pursuit of biological plausibility led me to a very unique bird, the Hoatzin!
It's notable for its chicks for distinctly having claws on each wing "hand", which it uses to clamber around on trees before it can fly.

	A Hoatzin!

.. admonition:: me/say

	I originally thought they were the only extant species that had this trait, but turns out even pretty mundane birds like chickens can have them too!
	It's a feature that's been in the bird genome since the proto-birds, and is normally dormant, until some evolution finds a use for them and brings it out again.

# Putting In The Hours

Despite this month of drawing being something I'm really proud of, in the grand scheme of things I'm still really new to it.
I've got plenty of friends that have had art as a hobby for years, many close to a decade, and are _orders of magnitude_ better.

A decade of practice and improvement is incredibly intimidating and feels insurmountable, but it's actually not that bad -- I've been doing this coding thing for over a decade now, starting in 2015.
I got to where I am pretty much completely self-taught, and it's proof to me of how I can get to a point in a hobby where I can comfortably whip up some pretty impressive things!

And I've still got plenty of decades left in my life to dedicate to skills like this.
As they say, _the time will pass anyways._
