.. admonition:: me/say

	Apologies for the ramble ahead :>

So, once again I burnt out.

I currently work at Canva, and on the surface everything seems pretty chill:
I'm in infrastructure, far away from user-facing life of product teams.
I'm still a junior, with the lowered expectations of that, and minimal deadlines or work pressures.
I've got a really nice manager, and the company culture as a whole is good!

And yet I still burned out really badly.
The cause this time?

	You might be wondering how I got here.

Always working with a crowd of people you struggle to relate to takes its toll on you.
It's not just gender -- it's the differences in values, experiences, interests, the way you socialise, etc.
Don't ask me to give concrete examples because most of the I can't -- only point to the _vibe_ I'm feeling.

And what I was getting from many people was _male friend group_ -- like high school boys that are friends with each other and no one else?
A sense of humor that's a touch demeaning, hobbies like video games?
Way too much of their identity in work?
Yeah, that -- it's kinda like a lesser version of techbros.

(It's not my whole team! There are guys I like talking to dw :>)

Fortunately, no actual misogyny or transphobia or whatever -- that at least seems to filter out by the interview process.
But computing is a male-dominated industry, infrastructure more so, and Canva, even with its reputation of [actually trying to have good diversity](https://www.canva.com/newsroom/news/The-importance-of-diversity-at-Canva/), is not immune.

But for a good part of a year, with me not going into the office much for several reasons (including minimising time with The Guys), my team was all I had.
Who I didn't end up socialising that much with.
And without anyone else to really empathise with me, I felt like I was losing my mind with how much I was burning out.
Because surely it wasn't that bad?

And then it was the week of my department on-site -- Canva calls it a "supergroup huddle" -- with almost everyone now in the same place.
And plenty of time to socialise.

While the tech leads were complaining away about, well, it doesn't matter, I ended up really getting along with this other female graduate engineer from Melbourne.
We chatted a lot and it sorta reaffirmed that yes, the stress of this is real, and no, I wasn't losing my mind.
I ended up connecting with a bunch more female engineers throughout the week and it was incredibly refreshing and helped my burnout a lot.
And fingers crossed, keeps it bay for long enough.

(I didn't end up going to much _team_ bonding events, though mostly because I was exhausted.
No regrets though)

Also, coincidentally, a coworker friend brought her trans friend to the office and we ended up having a chat for a while.
And the difference between how well I got along with them, compared to my team, was genuinely night-and-day.
Maybe it's the shared culture of being on Tumblr.

This whole thing also made me realise why I never felt like myself in the several male friend groups I've been through, and with people that aren't fully accepting of my transness.
My personal name for this is _background radiation_ -- an invisible aura in these environments that wears you down.
The concept of [masking] is probably related.

[masking]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masking_(behavior)

It's why I felt comfortable with my current group of queer friends that emerged from a shared hobby of role-playing games, so much so that it immediately replaced my old (mostly male) friend group in my life.
I feel like I can actually be as weird as I want to be!
And there isn't a shred of doubt that it will not just be accepted, but welcomed!

Maybe coincidence, maybe not, but my mental health improved dramatically after finding these people -- _my_ people.
