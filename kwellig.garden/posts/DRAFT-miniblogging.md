Every so often I'm reminded of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/) -- a challenge to write 100 posts in a year -- and get tempted to commit myself to it.
However, my current rate of posts -- single digits _per year_ -- is nowhere near what it would need to be for this challenge.
So if I were to ever do the challenge, I would have to really change how I write posts, and thinking about that (well, writing this post) made me think about how and why I write in the first place.

When I'm writing, I usually start out with a rough idea or "elevator pitch" of what I want to cover.
Often I don't start writing a concrete outline, especially for the first draft, since it always ends up being quite a mess as I figure out what exactly I want to say and how to say it.

I usually aim for decently long-form posts -- I'm mostly inspired by the more popular computing bloggers that write thousands of words.
Alas, I don't have the writing skills or the patience for that, so mine usually end up only being a decent couple hundred words, along with the occasional "mega-post" that's a few thousand.
Most of the time though, there's a pretty natural set of points to cover in a post, but if it's quite a bit less I usually try to find more to talk about to pad out the length a bit.

It's probably partly because this blog is mostly long-form content that I don't really want to make shorter posts.

# Wait, why do I write in the first place?

Most of the time: because it's fun and it's enjoyable.

When I do get a good idea for a blog post, there's often quite a bit of dopamine that comes from writing it, plus often an overwhelming desire for it to be done and over with.
Unfortunately, this is also why I struggle with consistently writing stuff.
It's also why I usually don't polish my posts too much after the first full draft.

Alas, this has has notably been soured [by my experiences of burnout].
Nowadays, even though the dopamine can get me through a whole day of tapping away writing a blog post (or any programming thing, for that matter), it does makes me feel a bit sick afterwards.
It honestly feels like an addiction at times.

Working on projects _sustainably_ is hard for me.

It's still really nice to have a website full of stuff I can show people.
Though...

# Who even reads these?

I don't know how many people read these.

I don't have anything to tell who does.

I don't think many people outside of people I know in real life look at my writing.

The limited analytics I do have says the vast majority of visitors are from Australia.
Probably most of that is just me.

So if you do, please let me know :) or comment/etc on my blog.
