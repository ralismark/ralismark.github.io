The Hag Coven Rule of Doom, or just simply the _Hag Coven Rule_ is as such:

.. sparkle::

	Three is the most unstable and drama-prone number of people living together.

It's been the common thread in a lot of sharehouse drama and conflict I've been witness to over the years.
Heck, I've even been in one myself!
(miserable experience, 0 stars, would not recommend)

They all follow the same pattern:
one pair gets along better and become much closer to each other than with the third, so whenever a disagreement arises the pair support each other against the third.
Or one of the pair just passive endorses and enables the other's shitty behaviour (that was the story of my situation).

It's an actual thing apparently, that ["two people seem emotionally closer when excluding a third party"][triangulation]!

[triangulation]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation_(psychology)

An alliance like that in a triad is such power imbalance -- two against one is a *super*majority that easily outvotes the third and push them around!
Even up to the point where their only option is to leave...
which has happened a few times...

This dynamic when you have three people is the reason behind the name:

> A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third.

Once burnt twice shy, so I have a rule against these 3-person sharehousing arrangements.
Over that is too many.
Living alone I start getting weird from lack of human contact.
So that leaves a pair as the only option.

Hopefully it'll will work out a lot better -- it should force the pair to directy talk to each other and sort out problems together, and do so on much more equal footing.
Rather than creating drama through a third.
