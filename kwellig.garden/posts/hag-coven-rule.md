In my years I've been witness to what feels like an oddly high amount of sharehouse drama.
I've heard about many cases among my friends, and I've even been in one myself.
They all seem to have one thing in common:
_they all involve sharehouses of 3 people._

It all follows the same pattern, of two people ganging up on the third.
It's very easy for a pair to become closer to each other than the third person.
And the two in the pair can side with each other there's a disagreement with the third, or even just one passively endorses the other's behaviour.

Turns out that ["two people seem emotionally closer when excluding a third party"][triangulation]!
Not great!

[triangulation]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation_(psychology)

And when you have two against one, that's a huge power imbalance -- two is a _supermajority_ over one and can easily push them around, whereas in a pair you have to directly talk to each other and figure things out together.

It's also the reason behind the name:

> A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third.

I've been burnt by this before, living in a triad consisting of me, a toxic guy, and their passively enabler friend.
It's why I have a personal rule against sharehousing with 2 other people.
Over that is too many, and living alone I start getting weird from lack of human contact, so that leaves a pair as the only option.
