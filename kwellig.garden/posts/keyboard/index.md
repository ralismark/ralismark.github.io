title: Wacky Keyboard Mods
excerpt: What you can achieve if you abandon keyboard conventions

For the past year or so, I've been using a split ortholinear keyboard known as the Nyquist[^1].
Its nonstandard design and the abundance of keys on the bottom row has led me to throw out many keyboard conventions, making something that is far more comfortable.

[^1]: You can see photos of this kind of keyboard [here](http://xahlee.info/kbd/nyquist_keyboard.html).

# Caps → Esc

Firstly, a less esoteric change.
The capslock key is useless so let's replace it with something useful -- I'm a Vim user so I made it <kbd>Esc</kbd>, but <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> is a popular alternative.

# Palm Keys

Palm Keys (see <https://superuser.com/a/317593>) is the idea of pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> with the side of your palm -- essentially the base of your pinky -- to avoid the strain on your pinky & awkward hand twists for some key combos (e.g. <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd>).

I can't praise this enough -- it's incredibly simple (I originally used Lego & blu-tack) and the benefits are immense.
I started using this mod around 1½ years ago, back when I still used a full-sized keyboard, and I've been using it ever since.

	This is so good I even converted my mum to using it for a while!

# Thumb Keys

Another mod that moves work away from the usual 4+4 fingers is to use your thumbs.
This is something that can only be fully exploited in custom keyboards -- see [/r/ergomechkeyboards][r-ergomk] -- since standard keyboards have a *massive* spacebar[^2] that limits which keys can be even pressed by your thumbs.

[^2]: I can't believe wide spacebars are standard. It's such a waste of prime keyboard real estate. Most people only use at most 2 key widths of it.

.. figure:: {{ recipe.copy("/assets/keyboard:layout.png", "./layout.png") }}

	My bottom row.
	Made with [keyboard-layout-editor.com](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/).

But, when done well, it's *extremely* comfortable.
You'll essentially always have your fingers on the home row.
YOU CAN ALSO TYPE SENTENCES IN UPPERCASE WITHOUT CAPSLOCK WITH EASE.

If you're stuck with a standard keyboard, you can get some of the benefit by rebinding right <kbd>Alt</kbd> to something more commonly used (shift, for example).

# Conclusion

Some of these changes are quite common on [/r/ergomechkeyboards][r-ergomk], so definitely go there if you'd like to see more of this, and [Xah's Keyboard Blog][xah-kb] is a treasure trove of similar keyboard mods.

In addition to these key mods, there's also the benefit of having a split keyboard -- being able to move the halves apart, and being able to tilt the keyboard -- both of which are quite nice.
There are even further improvement possible if you abandon qwerty, but that's too much of a muscle-memory-breaking change for me.
These changes are things that, once you try them, reveal just how far from optimal regular keyboards are.
Though they do make it harder to use a keyboard with only a single hand, like when you're eating.

And, if you're trying to avoid RSI, try (fingerless) gloves -- my hands become sore sooner if they're cold.
Also try using your mouse with your left hand.
