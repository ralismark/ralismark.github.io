.. admonition:: me/say

	I'll do a proper introduction to this series in a bit...

I don't like that my characters can permanently die before I get to resolve their character arc.
But at the same time, the risk of death is wonderful for ramping up the stakes of things, and making things more emotionally impactful.

(And sometimes you just die too soon and don't have time to create someone new so you just have their "long-lost" sibling appear.)

> So, your character has died.
>
> Instead of making a fresh new character to play, you can instead bring back and play one of your characters that previously died.
>
> (No, you can't resurrect the character that just died.
> Wait until the next one dies.)
>
> Whether it be through the intervention of some god or patron plucking them from the grasps of oblivion, or through their soul clawing out of the depth of Death one hand at a time, they've come back from their untimely demise.
> Returning the soul of the deceased to this world is always messy and never perfect.
> Make a major change; possibilities include:
>
> 1. Your continuity does not survive Death.
> 	Either no one remembers the you from before you died, or no one believes you are who you were from before you died.
> 2. Your personality and identity is warped by Death (or just that whole thing is extremely traumatic).
> 	Change a fundamental aspect of what makes you you.
> 3. Your soul was shoved into a vessel foreign to you.
> 	You may have different physical features, or a different ancestry[^race], or be of an entirely unrelated species (possibly monstrous!).
> 4. Your memories are blended by Death, but the emotions from them remain with you.
> 	You might fixate on one specific event and be fuelled by its rage or grief, or have a certain emotion or idea taint all your memories.
> 5. It came at a great cost, one that you will bear now that you are alive.
> 	You are still bound to whoever helped you out of Death.
> 6. You still have one foot not in this realm, metaphorically.
> 	You see the true nature of things, and cannot perceive illusions.
> 7. Only part of your soul comes back.
> 	The remaining part is still stuck in the realms of Death.
> 8. The body you are inhabiting now is not your own, not entirely.
> 	People think you are someone else, and the soul that was once there is still around somewhere.

Essentially the [Came Back Wrong trope](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong), with inspiration from the [Pact Web Serial](https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/) (by Wildbow).

Death of a character is a huge setback and could take weeks or months of real world time to reverse, but isn't an end to their story.

[^race]: In D&D this would be your race.
