One thing in D&D (and a lot of other systems) that irks me is how, if a character is better at a skill than others, they end up being the one doing _every_ attempt of that skill for the party.

_"Who's got the highest History modifier here?"_

All the incentives push characters away from even trying things other people are better at, especially if your party likes playing optimally.

_"I- Marrow steps aside to let Aspen, our gentle Paladin, try intimidate the guard instead."_

But what if, instead of simply being more likely to succeed as you got better at a skill, you instead simply got _more consistent_?

Smaller dice is more consistent -- you end up being either really sure you can succeed, or really sure you won't.
Bigger dice is more risky -- you have more of a shot at outlandish plans, but you struggle more with simple tasks.

.. admonition:: kith/say

	Don't you always wanna use the smallest dice for negative difficulty, and largest dice for positive difficulty?

You're right... but only if the players know how difficult something is!

Maybe we can add an additional clause:

> The greater you beat _or_ miss the difficulty score, the more the outcome is unexpected.

Anyways, there's actually 3 knobs you can turn with this system:

1. The size of the first dice.
	Maybe this increases as you become more worn down?
2. The size of the second dice.
3. Plus the age-old flat bonuses or penalties.

Plus the opportunity for silly mechanics which do things _between_ the two dice rolls.

The probability math becomes a lot more complicated than simply being always more likely to succeed a thing, but instead you get the dimension of _consistency_ to play with.
