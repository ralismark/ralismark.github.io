I've been thinking a lot about TTRPG mechanics lately.
Mostly about the things I've discovered I don't like about D&D.
But I'm coming up with some cool ideas, so might as well preserve them here.

Some are gonna be really fleshed out.
Others are just a sketch of an idea.

# Power Word (the Ivory Tower mechanic)

I came up with an idea for a mini ttrpg mechanic! magic based on _words_ and language.

Your magic is a single word, and you can make anything happen if you can phrase it using that word. Both literal and metaphorical, concrete and abstract.

If you can _mend_, you can _mend_ a torn shirt and _mend_ broken bones. But you can also _mend_ the reputation of a disgraced noble or even _mend_ a broken heart!

If you can _cut_, of course you can _cut_ through anything, but you can also help a drunk _cut_ down their alcohol consumption, or _cut_ through a dense forest to get somewhere faster.
