> On █/█/███, Foundation Site-107 underwent a massive dimensional shift, trapping all personnel inside dimensional anomaly SCP-6320. To date, attempts to contact outside help have proved unsuccessful.

An incredible audio fiction about life within the Foundation that's had monthly episodes since _2019_!
I've listened to every single episode -- each brings something new, the voice acting is incredible, and all the characters are so unique and flawed and loveable...
I think this deserves as much praise and attention as audio fiction powerhouses like [The Magnus Archives](https://rustyquill.com/show/the-magnus-archives/) and [Welcome to Night Vale](https://www.welcometonightvale.com/).
