fun facts:

1. Prominent Rust blogger [Amos / fasterthanli.me](https://fasterthanli.me) gave me a shout out on [one of his posts](https://fasterthanli.me/series/making-our-own-executable-packer/part-12#:~:text=Thanks%20to%20ralismark)
2. [My keyboard](posts/keyboard) is featured [in the Sydney Morning Herald](https://12ft.io/https://www.smh.com.au/technology/people-are-spending-7500-on-keyboards-maybe-you-should-too-20220524-p5ao6h.html#:~:text=Keyboards%20can%20cost%20hundreds%20or%20even%20thousands%20of%20dollars)! It actually costs under $200, rather than "hundreds or even thousands of dollars" that the caption implies.
3. I have [contributed](https://github.com/shlomif/fortune-mod/commits?author=ralismark) to a piece of software that is [over 40 years old][fortune]
4. I have about... [10 names](posts/april-fools-2024)!
