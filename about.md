This website is powered by Jekyll, and is [open source](https://github.com/ralismark/ralismark.github.io)!

For licensing, both of my content and the things I use, have a look at [this page]({% link licenses.md %}).

# whoami

- compsci student @ UNSW
- retired competitive programmer
- (previously) SWE @ algorithmic trading firm [Autumn Compass](https://autumncompass.com/)

I poke at a bunch of computing areas -- recently Nix, Rust, and contributing to Open Source.
I've also had experience with C++ & Go & bits of infra.

I also like making frontend things the old-school way with handwritten HTML/CSS and a touch of JavaScript.
This includes this website you're looking at, [some games] (try [this one]!), and [my personal wiki app].

[some games]: /webgames/
[this one]: /webgames/basalt-bashers/
[my personal wiki app]: /ibis-wiki/static/

Outside of tech, I play violin and am trying to memorise more Chinese, and I like learning about linguistics.
